# Script description

Script generates data.frame c with concepts (no definitions), it also has data.frame  d with all descriptions (including synonymns) and data.frame d2 with descriptions reduced to Fully Specified Name (FSN). SNOMED CT has one crucial limitations. Semantic tag for a given object is not available as a separate column. But since it is very usefull, it is extracted using regular expression from FSN.  
  
All functions start with 'sct_'. Functions are being added by user and usage requests.
