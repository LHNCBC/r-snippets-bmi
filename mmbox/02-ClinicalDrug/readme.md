# Problem

# Files

## tranlate_ndc_b-all.csv

Knowledge base. This file is derived from OMOP Vocabulary (concept_relationship table). It maps each NDC code first into `Branded Drug` (if applicable) and then to `Clinical Drug`.


# Note of .csv.zip files 
Puting files >100MB on Github is restricted. For this reason, large full files are zipped. In order to see a preview of the file, view the file with suffix `-preview' to see a preview of the full file.
