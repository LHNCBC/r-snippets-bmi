Chloroquine inhibits coronavirus replication at in vitro concentrations that are not cytotoxic and within a range of blood concentrations achievable during standard antimalarial treatment. Chloroquine inhibits viral replication through interference with glycosylation of coronavirus ACE2 receptors, required for viral entry, and downstream phagolysosome alkalisation, interfering with the low-pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating. Chloroquine also has anti-inflammatory properties and could provide benefit through this mechanism in Covid-19, where a cytokine storm has been described in critically ill patients. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic metabolite of chloroquine, has similar anti-inflammatory properties, and is more potent against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.",1,|,Khayelitsha Hospital|Groote Schuur Hospital,Cape Town|Cape Town,Western Cape|Western Cape,7784|7925,South Africa|South Africa,2
