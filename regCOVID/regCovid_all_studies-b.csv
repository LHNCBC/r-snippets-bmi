      With the participant's approval, and as approved by IRB, de-identified biological samples
      will be stored and tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. These samples may be used in
      future COVID-19 studies to develop assays or study other features of the disease. These
      leftovers may be used for multiple basic science analysis and potentially for genetic
      testing. The consent process will explain this to prospective participants.

      During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to
      have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with
      regard to biosample storage will not be possible after the study is completed. The consent
      process will explain this to prospective participants.

      straps will be used to ensure that the face mask is kept in place for the duration of the
      test. This mask will contain a material designed to capture exhaled respiratory droplets
      and/or aerosols. Several iterations of these impaction and filtration devices may be used to
      optimize functional attributes of the material for capture of COVID. These materials will
      always have a proven safety for use with humans.

      Subjects can talk, cough and sneeze in the mask or can temporarily remove the mask if
      uncomfortable, to drink some water etc if required. Total collection time spread across two
      masks will not exceed one hour

      For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper
      respiratory specimen. The following are acceptable specimens:

        -  A nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  Sputum specimen collected by a healthcare provider. Swab specimens should be collected
           using only swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Place swabs
           immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. Store the
           samples at 2-8Â°C up to 72 hours. If a delay in shipping or extraction is expected, store
           samples at -70Â°C in accordance with CDC's protocol.

      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
