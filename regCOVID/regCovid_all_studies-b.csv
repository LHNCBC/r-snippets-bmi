      Each sample will be tested using the EDITM diagnostic assay which detects the optical density
      of antibodies in serum samples to the nucleo-capsid protein SARS-CoV-2. Both IgM and IgG
      antibodies to the nucleo-capsid protein will be tested and reported.

      At the end of the study the samples will be stored at -70oC in the freezers of the Great
      Ormond Street Camelia Botnar Laboratories for future research. Future studies may involve
      genetic testing on the samples and this has been highlighted on the consent form.

      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
