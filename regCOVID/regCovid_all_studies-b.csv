      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
