# COVID19 Interventional Trials and Observational Studies

We use AACT (db connection via registered user; you must provide your own user name) to obtain most recent CTG (=ClinicalTrials.gov) data.
The script can be further improved.

## Search strategies
We use letters to denote search strategies. Strategy A uses title of trial. Strategy B uses MeSH keywords assigned by CTG (their algorhitm; not publicaly posted).

# Files
(will be updated frequently)

Suffix of file name captures subseting. INT means Interventional trials only. OBS means observational studies only. REGISTRY means CTG's registry category.

# Feedback
We don't claim our script is the best approach and are open to suggestions for improvement

# Future additions
- for each NCT - webscrape (or via XML) obtain evidence of updating a trial. An updated trial is viewed as more creditable.
- other registries (besides CTG)
