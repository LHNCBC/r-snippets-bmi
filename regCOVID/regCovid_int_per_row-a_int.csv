Chloroquine inhibits viral replication through interference with glycosylation of coronavirus ACE2 receptors, required for viral entry, and downstream phagolysosome alkalisation, interfering with the low-pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating. Chloroquine also has anti-inflammatory properties and could provide benefit through this mechanism in Covid-19, where a cytokine storm has been described in critically ill patients.
