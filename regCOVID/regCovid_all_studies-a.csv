      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.

      membrane filter with 3.0Î¼m pore size). All the tubes are then transported to the laboratory
      at 4Â°C, vortexed, and the VTM is aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C for subsequent laboratory
      analysis by RT-PCR. Viral loads will be measured from the patient's upper respiratory tract
      (nasopharyngeal flocked swab and throat swab) on admission and serially second daily during
      hospitalization by means of quantitative RT-PCR assay.

      For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper
      respiratory specimen. The following are acceptable specimens:

        -  A nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  Sputum specimen collected by a healthcare provider. Swab specimens should be collected
           using only swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Place swabs
           immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. Store the
           samples at 2-8Â°C up to 72 hours. If a delay in shipping or extraction is expected, store
           samples at -70Â°C in accordance with CDC's protocol.

      With the participant's approval, and as approved by IRB, de-identified biological samples
      will be stored and tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. These samples may be used in
      future COVID-19 studies to develop assays or study other features of the disease. These
      leftovers may be used for multiple basic science analysis and potentially for genetic
      testing. The consent process will explain this to prospective participants.

      During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to
      have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with
      regard to biosample storage will not be possible after the study is completed. The consent
      process will explain this to prospective participants.
