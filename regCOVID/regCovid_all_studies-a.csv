      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.

Chloroquine inhibits viral replication through interference with glycosylation of coronavirus ACE2 receptors, required for viral entry, and downstream phagolysosome alkalisation, interfering with the low-pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating. Chloroquine also has anti-inflammatory properties and could provide benefit through this mechanism in Covid-19, where a cytokine storm has been described in critically ill patients.
