      For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper
      respiratory specimen. The following are acceptable specimens:

        -  A nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  Sputum specimen collected by a healthcare provider. Swab specimens should be collected
           using only swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Place swabs
           immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. Store the
           samples at 2-8Â°C up to 72 hours. If a delay in shipping or extraction is expected, store
           samples at -70Â°C in accordance with CDC's protocol.

      Genetic Testing: We and others have shown that host genetic differences have a significant
      impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single
      nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from
      sepsis. We hypothesize that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation
      will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. Our research is designed to
      elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
