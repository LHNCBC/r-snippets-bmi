33972949,Preprint,NA,NA,LENZILUMAB EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN NEWLY HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 SUBJECTS: RESULTS FROM THE LIVE-AIR PHASE 3 RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL.,2021-05-15,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Severe COVID-19 pneumonia results from a hyperinflammatory immune response (cytokine storm, CS), characterized by GM-CSF mediated activation and trafficking of myeloid cells, leading to elevation of downstream inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1), and other markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin). CS leads to fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, ARDS, and death. Lenzilumab is a novel Humaneered <sup>Â®</sup> anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody that directly binds GM-CSF and prevents signaling through its receptor. The LIVE-AIR Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab to assess the potential for lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of ventilator-free survival (referred to herein as survival without ventilation, SWOV), beyond standard supportive care, in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Subjects with COVID-19 (n=520), â‰¥18 years, and â‰¤94% oxygen saturation on room air and/or requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259) via three intravenous infusions administered 8 hours apart. Subjects were followed through Day 28 following treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Baseline demographics were comparable between the two treatment groups: male, 64.7%; mean age, 60.5 years; mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m <sup>2</sup> ; mean CRP, 98.36 mg/L; CRP was &lt;150 mg/L in 77.9% of subjects. The most common comorbidities were obesity (55.1%), diabetes (53.4%), chronic kidney disease (14.0%), and coronary artery disease (13.6%). Subjects received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab improved the likelihood of SWOV by 54% in the mITT population (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.31, p=0.041) and by 90% in the ITT population (HR: 1.90; 1.02-3.52, nominal p=0.043) compared to placebo. SWOV also relatively improved by 92% in subjects who received both corticosteroids and remdesivir (1.92; 1.20-3.07, nominal p=0.0067); by 2.96-fold in subjects with CRP&lt;150 mg/L and age &lt;85 years (2.96; 1.63-5.37, nominal p=0.0003); and by 88% in subjects hospitalized â‰¤2 days prior to randomization (1.88; 1.13-3.12, nominal p=0.015). Survival was improved by 2.17-fold in subjects with CRP&lt;150 mg/L and age &lt;85 years (2.17; 1.04-4.54, nominal p=0.040).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV in hospitalized, hypoxic subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and/or corticosteroids.

Eligible patients were hospitalised adults (aged â‰¥18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test, and who met one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection: the presence of radiographic infiltrates on imaging, a peripheral oxygen saturation on room air of 94% or less, or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded if they had either an alanine aminotransferase or an aspartate aminotransferase concentration more than five times the upper limit of normal; had impaired renal function; were allergic to the study product; were pregnant or breast feeding; were already on mechanical ventilation; or were anticipating discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital within 72 h of enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily for up to 9 days and up to four doses of either 44 Î¼g interferon beta-1a (interferon beta-1a group plus remdesivir group) or placebo (placebo plus remdesivir group) administered subcutaneously every other day. Randomisation was stratified by study site and disease severity at enrolment. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to interferon beta-1a and placebo treatment; remdesivir treatment was given to all patients without masking. The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as the first day that a patient attained a category 1, 2, or 3 score on the eight-category ordinal scale within 28 days, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomised patients who were classified according to actual clinical severity. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment.

The mean duration of symptoms before enrolment was 8Â·7 days (SD 4Â·4) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group and 8Â·5 days (SD 4Â·3) days in the placebo plus remdesivir group. Patients in both groups had a time to recovery of 5 days (95% CI not estimable) (rate ratio of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group vs placebo plus remdesivir 0Â·99 [95% CI 0Â·87-1Â·13]; p=0Â·88).

Concurrently, several nutritional therapies and alternative supportive treatments are also being used and tested to reduce the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. In the context of COVID-19, improved nutrition that includes micronutrient supplementation to augment the immune system has been recognized as a viable approach to both prevent and alleviate the severity of the infection. The potential role of micronutrients as immune-boosting agents is particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries, which already have an existing high burden of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. A systematic literature review was performed to identify nutritional interventions that might prevent or aid in the recovery from COVID-19. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched electronically from February to April 2020. All abstracts and full-text articles were examined for their relevance to this review. The information gathered was collated under various categories. Deficiencies of micronutrients, especially vitaminsâ€‰A, B complex, C, and D, zinc, iron, and selenium, are common among vulnerable populations in general and among COVID-19 patients in particular and could plausibly increase the risk of mortality. Judicious use of need-based micronutrient supplementation, alongside existing micronutrient fortification programs, is warranted in the current global pandemic, especially in low- and middle-income economies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.

The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (0Â·5 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 97Â·9% of patients.

The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (4Â·7%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (5Â·8%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0Â·79, 95Â·1% CI 0Â·61-1Â·03; p=0Â·081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (4Â·6%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (6Â·0%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 0Â·75, 0Â·57-0Â·99; p=0Â·042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (4Â·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (6Â·3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0Â·051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (2Â·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (4Â·1%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0Â·021).

Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">The Government of Quebec, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the US National Institutes of Health, the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation, the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the Rudin Family Foundation, and philanthropist Sophie Desmarais.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 The Authors.

This document provides the rationale and background for the trial and highlights key design features. We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multicenter, randomized trial during a pandemic, including <i>1</i>) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; <i>2</i>) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; <i>3</i>) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; <i>4</i>) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and <i>5</i>) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multicenter trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics. The ORCHID trial will provide high-quality, clinically relevant data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04332991).</AbstractText>",NCT04332991,Abstract,4/2/2020,6/19/2020,Interventional,Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Among In-patients With Symptomatic Disease,Completed,Phase 3,Massachusetts General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492354,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04332991,2,0,2,1,United States,1,9,Hydroxychloroquine|Placebo,5.087388781014024,0

Early in the outbreak period, transplant societies recommended suspending living kidney transplant programs in communities with widespread transmission to avoid exposing recipients to increased risk of immunosuppression, while recommendations were made to reserve deceased-donor kidney transplantation for likely life-saving indications. SOT recipients may be at high risk from COVID-19 disease due to chronic immunosuppressive treatment and other medical comorbidities. Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. In addition to high rates of complications and mortality attributable to COVID-19 infections, the pandemic has also led to additional complexities in transplantation including new questions regarding screening of donors and recipients, decision making to accept a patient for kidney transplant or wait after pandemic. The clinical implications of COVID-19 infection may also differ depending on the type of the transplanted organ and recipient comorbidities which further impacts decisions on continuing transplantation during the pandemic. Transplant activity during a pandemic should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Furthermore, while tremendous strides have been made in treatment strategies and vaccinations, the impact of these in transplant recipients may be attenuated in the setting of their immunosuppression. In this review, we aim to summarize several aspects of COVID-19 in transplantation, including the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, clinical outcomes in SOT recipients, and end-stage kidney disease patients, transplant activity during the pandemic, and treatment options for COVID-19 disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. A second vaccination with 100Â Î¼g was not administered because of the increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared with the 30-Î¼g dose.

Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset ( NCT04348656 ). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500â€‰ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. In total, 940 patients were randomized, and 921 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear. <b>Methods:</b> The Pass ive I mmunity T rial for O ur N ation (PassITON), is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the United States to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days.

Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phaseÂ 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on dayÂ 22. Free C5 levelsâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.5Â Î¼g/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing intervalâ€‰&gt;â€‰175Â Î¼g/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240â€‰Â±â€‰67Â Î¼g/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remainedâ€‰&gt;â€‰175Â Î¼g/mL and free C5 concentrations remainedâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.5Â Î¼g/mL.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22Â days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phaseÂ 3 study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04369469.</AbstractText>",NCT04369469,Abstract,5/11/2020,2/8/2021,Interventional,Efficacy and Safety Study of IV Ravulizumab in Patients With COVID-19 Severe Pneumonia,Terminated,Phase 3,Alexion Pharmaceuticals,Met futility bar at interim analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33826106,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04369469,3,0,3,1,United States|France|Japan|Spain|United Kingdom,0,10,Ravulizumab|Best Supportive Care,4.688774422301709,0

COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality have been attributed to an exaggerated immune response. The role of complement activation and its contribution to illness severity is being increasingly recognized. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the interaction of coronaviruses with the complement system. We posit that (a) coronaviruses activate multiple complement pathways; (b) severe COVID-19 clinical features often resemble complementopathies; (c) the combined effects of complement activation, dysregulated neutrophilia, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability appear to be intertwined to drive the severe features of COVID-19; (d) a subset of patients with COVID-19 may have a genetic predisposition associated with complement dysregulation; and (e) these observations create a basis for clinical trials of complement inhibitors in life-threatening illness.</AbstractText>",NCT04369469,Abstract,5/11/2020,2/8/2021,Interventional,Efficacy and Safety Study of IV Ravulizumab in Patients With COVID-19 Severe Pneumonia,Terminated,Phase 3,Alexion Pharmaceuticals,Met futility bar at interim analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32554923,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04369469,3,0,3,1,United States|France|Japan|Spain|United Kingdom,0,10,Ravulizumab|Best Supportive Care,4.673501612445353,0

The study compared the effectiveness of the vaccine to a placebo in 43,783Â adults from Latin America, South Africa, and the United States. Of those, 19,630 got a single dose of the vaccine. Compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical COVID-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical COVID-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe COVID-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe COVID-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment None of the vaccinated participants died from COVID-19. There were 5Â people who got the placebo who died from COVID-19. The vaccine was similarly effective in people from all age groups and different countries, including South Africa, where most cases were caused by the beta variant of the virus that originated there. The people in the study who got the vaccine who went on to get COVID-19 generally had milder and fewer symptoms than those who got the placebo. In most people, the vaccine started working after about 2 weeks. After receiving the vaccine, some people experienced pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, and nausea. In most cases, these were mild and went away within a few days. Serious side effects were very rare. Blood clots, seizures, and tinnitus were very rare but were more common in the people who got the vaccine than in those who got the placebo. At the time of the study, it was not clear if these were caused by the vaccine or not.

Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose-escalating cohorts to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone have likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery. Analysis of additional endpoints, including supportive biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, HMGB1, soluble-RAGE, D-dimer), will be performed to further define the effect of DSTAT in patients with COVID-19 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">ClinicalTrials.gov identifier; NCT04389840, Registered 13 May 2020.</AbstractText>",NCT04389840,Abstract,6/3/2020,5/20/2021,Interventional,Dociparstat for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19 in Adults at High Risk of Respiratory Failure,Terminated,Phase 2/Phase 3,Chimerix,Limited enrollment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33108622,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04389840,1,0,1,1,United States,0,12,Dociparstat sodium|Placebo,4.284032322716175,0
