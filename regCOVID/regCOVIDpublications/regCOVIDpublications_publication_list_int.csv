CS leads to fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, ARDS, and death. Lenzilumab is a novel Humaneered <sup>Â®</sup> anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody that directly binds GM-CSF and prevents signaling through its receptor. The LIVE-AIR Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab to assess the potential for lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of ventilator-free survival (referred to herein as survival without ventilation, SWOV), beyond standard supportive care, in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Subjects with COVID-19 (n=520), â‰¥18 years, and â‰¤94% oxygen saturation on room air and/or requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259) via three intravenous infusions administered 8 hours apart. Subjects were followed through Day 28 following treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Baseline demographics were comparable between the two treatment groups: male, 64.7%; mean age, 60.5 years; mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m <sup>2</sup> ; mean CRP, 98.36 mg/L; CRP was &lt;150 mg/L in 77.9% of subjects. The most common comorbidities were obesity (55.1%), diabetes (53.4%), chronic kidney disease (14.0%), and coronary artery disease (13.6%). Subjects received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab improved the likelihood of SWOV by 54% in the mITT population (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.31, p=0.041) and by 90% in the ITT population (HR: 1.90; 1.02-3.52, nominal p=0.043) compared to placebo. SWOV also relatively improved by 92% in subjects who received both corticosteroids and remdesivir (1.92; 1.20-3.07, nominal p=0.0067); by 2.96-fold in subjects with CRP&lt;150 mg/L and age &lt;85 years (2.96; 1.63-5.37, nominal p=0.0003); and by 88% in subjects hospitalized â‰¤2 days prior to randomization (1.88; 1.13-3.12, nominal p=0.015).

Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS"">Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma.

This document provides the rationale and background for the trial and highlights key design features. We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multicenter, randomized trial during a pandemic, including <i>1</i>) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; <i>2</i>) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; <i>3</i>) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; <i>4</i>) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and <i>5</i>) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multicenter trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics. The ORCHID trial will provide high-quality, clinically relevant data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04332991).</AbstractText>",NCT04332991,Abstract,4/2/2020,6/19/2020,Interventional,Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Among In-patients With Symptomatic Disease,Completed,Phase 3,Massachusetts General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492354,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04332991,2,0,2,1,79917485,United States,1,9,Hydroxychloroquine|Placebo,0,4.1032

The study was done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA, and was led by the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing or clinical criteria who were not being treated in hospital were eligible if they were at least 40 years old and had at least one high-risk characteristic. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (0Â·5 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 97Â·9% of patients. The analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COLCORONA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04322682) and is now closed to new participants.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Trial enrolment began in March 23, 2020, and was completed in Dec 22, 2020. A total of 4488 patients (53Â·9% women; median age 54Â·0 years, IQR 47Â·0-61Â·0) were enrolled and 2235 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine and 2253 to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (4Â·7%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (5Â·8%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0Â·79, 95Â·1% CI 0Â·61-1Â·03; p=0Â·081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (4Â·6%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (6Â·0%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 0Â·75, 0Â·57-0Â·99; p=0Â·042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (4Â·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (6Â·3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0Â·051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (2Â·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (4Â·1%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0Â·021).

Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">The Government of Quebec, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the US National Institutes of Health, the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation, the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the Rudin Family Foundation, and philanthropist Sophie Desmarais.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

Early in the outbreak period, transplant societies recommended suspending living kidney transplant programs in communities with widespread transmission to avoid exposing recipients to increased risk of immunosuppression, while recommendations were made to reserve deceased-donor kidney transplantation for likely life-saving indications. SOT recipients may be at high risk from COVID-19 disease due to chronic immunosuppressive treatment and other medical comorbidities. Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. In addition to high rates of complications and mortality attributable to COVID-19 infections, the pandemic has also led to additional complexities in transplantation including new questions regarding screening of donors and recipients, decision making to accept a patient for kidney transplant or wait after pandemic. The clinical implications of COVID-19 infection may also differ depending on the type of the transplanted organ and recipient comorbidities which further impacts decisions on continuing transplantation during the pandemic. Transplant activity during a pandemic should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Furthermore, while tremendous strides have been made in treatment strategies and vaccinations, the impact of these in transplant recipients may be attenuated in the setting of their immunosuppression. In this review, we aim to summarize several aspects of COVID-19 in transplantation, including the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, clinical outcomes in SOT recipients, and end-stage kidney disease patients, transplant activity during the pandemic, and treatment options for COVID-19 disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phaseÂ 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on dayÂ 22. Free C5 levelsâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.5Â Î¼g/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition.

Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were two such candidates.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">Assess the relative efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We performed a randomized clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Treatment was 5 days of study medication. The primary endpoint was the COVID Ordinal Outcomes scale at day 14. Secondary endpoints included hospital-, ICU-, and ventilator-free days at day 28. The trial was stopped early after enrollment of 85 patients when a separate clinical trial concluded that a clinically important effect of hydroxychloroquine over placebo was definitively excluded. Comparisons were made a priori using a proportional odds model from a Bayesian perspective.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We enrolled 85 patients at 13 hospitals over 11 weeks. Adherence to study medication was high. The estimated odds ratio for less favorable status on the ordinal scale for hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin from the primary analysis was 1.07, with a 95% credible interval from 0.63 to 1.83 with a posterior probability of 60% that hydroxychloroquine was worse than azithryomycin. Secondary outcomes displayed a similar, slight preference for azithromycin over hydroxychloroquine. QTc prolongation was rare and did not differ between groups. The twenty safety outcomes were similar between arms with the possible exception of post-randomization onset acute kidney injury, which was more common with hydroxychloroquine (15% vs. 0%). Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm received remdesivir more often than in the azithromycin arm (19% vs. 2%). There was no apparent association between remdesivir use and acute kidney injury.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">While early termination limits the precision of our results, we found no suggestion of substantial efficacy for hydroxychloroquine over azithromycin. Acute kidney injury may be more common with hydroxychloroquine than azithromycin, although this may be due to the play of chance. Differential use of remdesivir may have biased our results in favor of hydroxychloroquine. Our results are consistent with conclusions from other trials that hydroxychloroquine cannot be recommended for inpatients with COVID-19; azithromycin may merit additional investigation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">This trial was prospectively registered (NCT04329832) before enrollment of the first patient.</AbstractText>",NCT04329832,Abstract,3/30/2020,12/18/2020,Interventional,Hydroxychloroquine vs. Azithromycin for Hospitalized Patients With Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19,"Active, not recruiting",Phase 2,"Intermountain Health Care, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166179,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04329832,2,0,2,1,74845593,United States,0,3,Hydroxychloroquine|Azithromycin,0,3.6145

The IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in COVID-19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of low-dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) â‰¥Â 40Â mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400Â mg or 8Â mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200Â mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48Â hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty-two patients received low-dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL-6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24-48Â hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40-200Â mg. Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3Â days (interquartile range, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival. A possible explanation is that survivors remained hospitalized at their baseline clinical status.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04359810.FUNDINGAmazon Foundation, Skoll Foundation.</AbstractText>",NCT04359810,Abstract,4/21/2020,12/30/2020,Interventional,Plasma Therapy of COVID-19 in Severely Ill Patients,Completed,Phase 2,Columbia University,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33974559,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04359810,3,0,3,1,81314503,United States|Brazil,0,4,Convalescent Plasma (anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma)|Non-convalescent Plasma (control plasma),0,3.579

We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteriaÂ for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer.Â We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease),Â development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease),Â quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included 13Â studies (12 RCTs, 1Â NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880Â received convalescent plasma.Â We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100Â ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33Â studies reportingÂ as being completed orÂ terminated. Individuals withÂ a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19Â and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and oneÂ NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participantsÂ with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placeboÂ or standard care alone.Â  Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR)Â 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05;Â 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants;Â high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable;Â 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants;Â high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participantsÂ requiring invasive mechanical ventilationÂ at baseline (RRÂ 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93;Â 2 RCTs, 630 participants;Â low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RRÂ 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants;Â high-certainty evidence).Â We did not identify any subgroup differences.Â  We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCTÂ assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RRÂ 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants;Â very low-certainty evidence).Â  Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and oneÂ NRSI, to assess the safety ofÂ convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety dataÂ only forÂ the convalescent plasma group.Â  We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reducesÂ the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RRÂ 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41;Â 4 RCTs, 905 participants;Â low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RRÂ 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90;Â 2 RCTs, 414 participants;Â low-certainty evidence).Â  A summary ofÂ reported events of theÂ NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000Â ofÂ 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety dataÂ only forÂ transfused participants (6125Â participants) are included in theÂ full text. IndividualsÂ withÂ a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCTÂ reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline).Â  Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortalityÂ (RRÂ 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65;Â very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable;Â low-certainty evidence).Â  We identified no study reporting quality of life.Â  Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence.

While vaccines remain the primary option for COVID-19 prevention, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, have been shown to benefit certain subpopulations after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÂ 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Unlike vaccine-derived immunity that develops over time, administration of neutralizing mAbs is an immediate and passive immunotherapy, with the potential to reduce disease progression, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and death. Bamlanivimab alone and together with etesevimab hold emergency use authorizations in several countries globally, with countries increasingly transitioning to the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and other authorized mAbs on the basis of their evolving variant landscape, regulatory authorizations, and access to drugs. The current guidelines for the administration of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab are informed by an iterative process of testing and development. Herein the rationale for these guidelines is provided by sharing the learnings that have been gathered throughout the development process of these mAbs. In addition, this review addresses the most common clinical questions received from health care professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding indicated population, dose, use with other medications and vaccines, duration of protection, and variants in clinical practice. As prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants can differ by country and state, prescribing HCPs should consider the prevalence of bamlanivimab and etesevimab resistant variants in their area, where data are available, regarding potential efficacy impact when considering treatment options.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04427501; NCT04411628; NCT04497987; NCT04634409.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021.

Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 212 to 354), regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 96% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 15, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells.

The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-Î³.

If the mouth and nose of HCWs are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help reduce the risk of active infection being passed from infected patients to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However,Â the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves, or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. Understanding these possible side effects is particularly important when the HCWs are otherwise fit and well.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect themselves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searchedÂ the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EmbaseÂ and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020.Â  SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We therefore planned to include the following types of studies:Â RCTs;Â quasi-RCTs;Â non-randomised controlled trials;Â prospective cohort studies;Â retrospective cohort studies;Â cross-sectional studies;Â controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. Â  We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration,Â delivered to HCWs, with or without the same intervention being given to the patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell).Â Our secondary outcomes were: 3)Â viral content of aerosol, when present (if intervention administered to patients); 4) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 5) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion.Â We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We found noÂ completed studies to include in this review. We identified three ongoing studies (including two RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 700Â participants. The interventionsÂ included in these trials areÂ povidone iodine, nitric oxideÂ and GLS-1200 oral spray (the constituent of this spray is unclear and may not be antimicrobial in nature). Â  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by two RCTs and a non-randomised study. WeÂ are concerned that only one of the ongoing studies specifically states that it will evaluate adverse events and it is not clear if this will include changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasalÂ microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review,Â it may not be large. InÂ these circumstances in particular, where those receiving theÂ intervention are otherwise fit and well,Â it may be a challengeÂ to weighÂ up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, RV dysfunction develops due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, inflammation, and alveolar overdistension or atelectasis. Although similar pathogenic mechanisms may induce RV dysfunction in COVID-19, other COVID-19-specific pathology, such as pulmonary endothelialitis, thrombosis, or myocarditis, may also affect RV function. We quantified RV dysfunction by echocardiographic strain analysis and investigated its correlation with disease severity, ventilatory parameters, biomarkers, and imaging findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We determined RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) in 32 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure.

FWLS correlated negatively with age (r = -0.414, <i>P</i> = 0.018) and with serum troponin (r = 0.402, <i>P</i> = 0.034). Patients with abnormal RV strain did not exhibit decreased oxygenation or increased disease severity based on inflammatory markers, vasopressor requirements, or chest imaging findings.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">RV dysfunction is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and is not related to abnormal lung mechanics or ventilatory pressures.

Excessive IL-6 plasma levels correlate with higher mortality (p-value 0.001). Additionally, based on our classification analysis, combination of IL-6 elevation and high levels of serum glucose can identify highest risk-group of COVID19 patients. Furthermore, we explore the role of genetic regulatory variants affecting baseline IL-6 levels specifically in COVID-19 patients. We have directly tested the association between variants in the IL6 and IL6R gene region and IL6 plasma levels. We provide results for a common IL-6 variant previously associated with pneumonia, rs1800795, and rs2228145 that was previously shown to affect IL-6 plasma levels, as well as report on novel variants associated with IL-6 plasma levels detected in our study patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">While it is unlikely that ""cytokine storm"" is the norm in severe COVID19, baseline elevations above 150Â pg/ml may be associated with worst outcomes and as such may warrant treatment considerations.

To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic COVID-19. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and by the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at other enrolling centers. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, reported through flyers and posters, and published on related website or media in combating against this widespread contagious diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Clinicaltrials.gov.

As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide (<sup>â€¢</sup>NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>â€¢-</sup>), pulmonary <sup>â€¢</sup>NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients. Introducing <sup>â€¢</sup>NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived <sup>â€¢</sup>NO. The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation. An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method's efficacy. INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, due to the rapid inactivation of <sup>â€¢</sup>NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of <sup>â€¢</sup>NO will not protect remote organs. Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O<sub>2</sub><sup>â€¢-</sup>-driven destruction of <sup>â€¢</sup>NO by neutralizing inflammatory O<sub>2</sub><sup>â€¢-</sup>. By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e.g., AEOL 10150), salen type (e.g., EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e.g., M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate-MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings. Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO. From the authors' viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2. Five days after submission of the current manuscript, Galera Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized, double-blind pilot phase II clinical trial with GC4419 for COVID-19.

Cleaved GSDMD forms membrane pores, leading to cytokine release and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). Inhibiting GSDMD is an attractive strategy to curb inflammation. Here we identify disulfiram, a drug for treating alcohol addiction, as an inhibitor of pore formation by GSDMD but not other members of the GSDM family. Disulfiram blocks pyroptosis and cytokine release in cells and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic death in mice. At nanomolar concentration, disulfiram covalently modifies human/mouse Cys191/Cys192 in GSDMD to block pore formation. Disulfiram still allows IL-1Î² and GSDMD processing, but abrogates pore formation, thereby preventing IL-1Î² release and pyroptosis. The role of disulfiram in inhibiting GSDMD provides new therapeutic indications for repurposing this safe drug to counteract inflammation, which contributes to many human diseases.</AbstractText>",NCT04485130,Registry,5/1/2021,12/31/2021,Interventional,DISulfiram for COvid-19 (DISCO) Trial,Recruiting,Phase 2,"University of California, San Francisco",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32367036,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04485130,0,6,6,1,81166809,United States,0,6,Disulfiram|Placebo,0,3.5027

Multiple cytokines have been implicated in CRS, but levels of tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) (LIGHT) have not been previously measured in this setting. In this study, we observed significantly elevated serum LIGHT levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to healthy age- and gender-matched control patients. The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (<i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.0209) in those who died than in survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients, with significantly (<i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died than in survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited success in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses. The findings presented here demonstrate that LIGHT is a cytokine which may play an important role in COVID-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and CRS and suggest that LIGHT neutralization may be beneficial to COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Perlin et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04412057,Abstract,6/9/2020,12/2/2020,Interventional,Clinical Trial to Evaluate CERC-002 in Adults With COVID-19 Pneumonia and Acute Lung Injury,Completed,Phase 2,Cerecor Inc,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817460,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04412057,1,0,1,1,79636030,United States,0,6,CERC-002|Placebo,0,3.5003

Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID-19. Â A thorough understanding of theÂ current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatmentÂ for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on randomised controlled trialsÂ (RCTs) is required.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess the effects ofÂ remdesivir comparedÂ to placebo or standard care aloneÂ on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed,Â Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform,Â and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirusÂ diseaseÂ to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions.Â We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included RCTs evaluatingÂ remdesivir for theÂ treatment ofÂ SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting.Â  We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivirÂ for theÂ treatment of other coronavirus diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We ratedÂ the certaintyÂ of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, adverse events (any grade), and serious adverse events.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low-flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID-19 patients to recruit. Risk of bias was considered to be of some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individualsÂ  Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Considering the initial severity of condition, only one study showed a beneficial effect of remdesivir in patients who received low-flow oxygen at baseline (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66, 435 participants), but conflicting results exists from another study, and we were unable to validly assess this observations due to limited availability of comparable data. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low-certainty evidence). Â  We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low-certainty evidence); new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22;Â RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low-certainty evidence).Â  None of the included studies reported quality of life. Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86Â to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low-certainty evidence).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">Based on the currently available evidence, we are moderately certain that remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to validly examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality in subgroups depending on the extent of respiratory support at baseline.Â  Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID-19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease-related quality of life andÂ serious adverse effects.

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included one study with 18 participants, which compared the use of a 15-day course of oral steroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) with no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at baseline, 20 and 40 days. Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention Recovery of sense of smell was assessed after 40 days (25 days after cessation of treatment) using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) score. This tool has a range of 0 to 100, and a score of â‰¥ 90 represents normal olfactory function. TheÂ evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this intervention on recovery of the sense of smell at one to three monthsÂ (5/9 participants in the intervention group scored â‰¥ 90 compared to 0/9 in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 11.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 173.66; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense of smell was assessed using the CCCRC score at 40 days. This study reported an improvement in sense of smell in the intervention group from baseline (median improvement in CCCRC score 60, interquartile range (IQR) 40) compared to the control group (median improvement in CCCRC score 30, IQR 25) (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events andother adverse events were not identified in any participants of this study;Â however, it is unclear how these outcomes were assessed and recorded (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection.

Enrolment began Apr. 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the composite of hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days.

Four participants in the hydroxychloroquine group met the primary outcome (4 hospitalizations, 0 mechanical ventilation, 4 survived to 30 days) and none in the placebo group. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce symptom duration (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.21).

Although we had not identified concerns in a safety review, enrolment was slower than expected among those eligible for the study, and cases within the community were decreasing. Recruitment goals were deemed to be unattainable and the trial was not resumed, resulting in a study underpowered to assess the effect of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and safety.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">There was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced symptom duration or prevented severe outcomes among outpatients with proven COVID-19, but the early termination of our study meant that it was underpowered.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

However, personal protective equipment and staffing shortages, disease virulence, and infectivity have created significant barriers to traditional clinical trial practices. We present the novel design of a pragmatic, adaptive, multicenter, international, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of awake prone positioning in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 (Awake Prone Positioning for Early Hypoxemia in COVID-19 [APPEX-19]). Key innovations of this trial include: 1) a novel smartphone-based communication process that facilitates rapid enrollment and intervention delivery while allowing social distancing and conservation of personal protective equipment; 2) a Bayesian response-adaptive randomization to allow preferential assignment to the most effective intervention and expedite trial completion compared with frequentist designs; 3) remote electronic collection of patient-reported outcomes and electronic medical record data; and 4) pragmatic prospective utilization of patient-reported data and data collected as part of routine clinical care.

Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients. Statistical analysis was performed in December 2020.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Interventions"">Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Main Outcomes and Measures"">The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization. COVID-19-associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Results"">Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years. A total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo. At first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility. The proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group. We found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19-associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]).

This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04355936,Abstract,5/19/2020,11/2/2020,Interventional,Telmisartan for Treatment of COVID-19 Patients,Completed,Phase 4,Laboratorio Elea Phoenix S.A.,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32356926,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04355936,2,0,2,0,NA,Argentina,0,8,Telmisartan arm will receive 80 mg Telmisartan twice daily plus standard care.,0,3.1137

Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Findings"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Between March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84-265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71-329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group <i>vs</i> 41% in the control group; difference -24% [95% CI -58 to 9], p=0Â·15. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0-31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4-49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0Â·65 [95% CI 0Â·10-4Â·14]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group <i>vs</i> seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Interpretation"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">In this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Funding"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">InflaRx.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included.

Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7â€‰days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug's safety profile.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 Î¼M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 Î¼M) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

There is an urgency of developing a therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of COVID-19. Towards that initiative, potential drugs like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin have been tested by diverse group of researchers worldwide for their potential against novel coronavirus. The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMPÎ±/Î²1) mediated viral import. Azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base. All the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection. However, their efficacies need to be studied in detail individually and in combination in-vivo in order to combat COVID-19 infection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04673214,Registry,12/16/2020,2/2/2021,Interventional,Evaluation of Prognostic Modification in COVID-19 Patients in Early Intervention Treatment,Recruiting,Phase 3,"CoordinaciÃ³n de InvestigaciÃ³n en Salud, Mexico",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32322397,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04673214,0,6,6,0,NA,Mexico,0,4,Azithromycin / Ivermectin / Ribaroxaban / Paracetamol|Azithromycin / Ribaroxaban / Paracetamol,0,3.1018

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.

Patients (aged â‰¥18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, and who had COVID-19 symptoms for up to 14 days before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation was in-hospital oral rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients, or initial subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice per day) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (to achieve a 0Â·3-0Â·7 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration) for clinically unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban to day 30. Prophylactic anticoagulation was standard in-hospital enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. The primary efficacy outcome was a hierarchical analysis of time to death, duration of hospitalisation, or duration of supplemental oxygen to day 30, analysed with the win ratio method (a ratio &gt;1 reflects a better outcome in the therapeutic anticoagulation group) in the intention-to-treat population.

One patient, in the therapeutic group, was lost to follow-up because of withdrawal of consent and was not included in the primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between patients assigned therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, with 28â€ˆ899 (34Â·8%) wins in the therapeutic group and 34â€ˆ288 (41Â·3%) in the prophylactic group (win ratio 0Â·86 [95% CI 0Â·59-1Â·22], p=0Â·40). Consistent results were seen in clinically stable and clinically unstable patients. The primary safety outcome of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 26 (8%) patients assigned therapeutic anticoagulation and seven (2%) assigned prophylactic anticoagulation (relative risk 3Â·64 [95% CI 1Â·61-8Â·27], p=0Â·0010). Allergic reaction to the study medication occurred in two (1%) patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group and three (1%) in the prophylactic anticoagulation group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">In patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin followed by rivaroxaban to day 30 did not improve clinical outcomes and increased bleeding compared with prophylactic anticoagulation. Therefore, use of therapeutic-dose rivaroxaban, and other direct oral anticoagulants, should be avoided in these patients in the absence of an evidence-based indication for oral anticoagulation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Coalition COVID-19 Brazil, Bayer SA.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (focusing on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? <i>Discussions</i>. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution.

However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the target plasma and lung concentrations of these drugs following approved dosing in humans. Accordingly, concentration 90% (EC<sub>90</sub> ) values recalculated from in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) at an approved dose in humans (C<sub>max</sub> /EC<sub>90</sub> ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analyzed drugs achieved a C<sub>max</sub> /EC<sub>90</sub> ratio above 1. A more in-depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval. An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (K<sub>p</sub> U<sub>lung</sub> ) was also simulated to derive a lung C<sub>max</sub> /half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub> ) as a better indicator of potential human efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir-boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin, and lopinavir (ritonavir-boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC<sub>50</sub> . Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC<sub>50</sub> by 7.8-fold and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritizing compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC<sub>90</sub> values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments, such as the lungs, in order to maximize the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

Respiratory medicine,"<AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis, with considerable mortality and morbidity exerting pressure on health-care resources, including critical care. An excessive host inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Timely therapeutic intervention with immunomodulation in patients with hyperinflammation could prevent disease progression to ARDS and obviate the need for invasive ventilation. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a pivotal role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory diseases. GM-CSF could link T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation. This axis has been targeted in cytokine storm syndromes and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we consider the scientific rationale for therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation.

The leading cause of death is severe acute respiratory syndrome as a consequence of exacerbated inflammatory response accompanied by uncontrolled oxidative stress as well as the inflammatory reaction at the lung level. Until now, there is not a specific and definitive treatment for this pathology that worries the world population, especially the older adults who constitute the main risk group. In this context, it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide. Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction. The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs. Therefore, it is also essential to analyze this potential therapeutic association and their relation with RAS as part of this new approach.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Convalescent plasma had high neutralizing activity (median [interquartile range] titer 1:526 [1:359-1:786]) and its administration increased antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 14.4%, whereas standard plasma administration led to an 8.6% decrease (p = 0.005).

We aimed to explore safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this single-arm open-label vaccination substudy within the protocol of the larger phase 2/3 trial COV002, adults aged 18-55 years with HIV were enrolled at two HIV clinics in London, UK. Eligible participants were required to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with undetectable plasma HIV viral loads (&lt;50 copies per mL), and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per Î¼L. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4-6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination. Outcomes were analysed in all participants who received both doses and with available samples. The COV002 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and is ongoing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between Nov 5 and Nov 24, 2020, 54 participants with HIV (all male, median age 42Â·5 years [IQR 37Â·2-49Â·8]) were enrolled and received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Median CD4 count at enrolment was 694Â·0 cells per Î¼L (IQR 573Â·5-859Â·5). No serious adverse events occurred. Local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after prime vaccination included pain at the injection site (26 [49%] of 53 participants with available data), fatigue (25 [47%]), headache (25 [47%]), malaise (18 [34%]), chills (12 [23%]), muscle ache (19 [36%]), joint pain (five [9%]), and nausea (four [8%]), the frequencies of which were similar to the HIV-negative participants. Anti-spike IgG responses by ELISA peaked at day 42 (median 1440 ELISA units [EUs; IQR 704-2728]; n=50) and were sustained until day 56 (median 941 EUs [531-1445]; n=49). We found no correlation between the magnitude of the anti-spike IgG response at day 56 and CD4 cell count (p=0Â·93) or age (p=0Â·48). ELISpot and T-cell proliferative responses peaked at day 14 and 28 after prime dose and were sustained to day 56. Compared with participants without HIV, we found no difference in magnitude or persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral or cellular responses (p&gt;0Â·05 for all analyses).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">In this study of people with HIV, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was safe and immunogenic, supporting vaccination for those well controlled on ART.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. <sup>5,6</sup>). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)<sup>7</sup> given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-Î± cytokine secretion by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced.

Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged â‰¥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2Â·2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3Â·5-6Â·5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged â‰¥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20â€ˆ713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13â€ˆ898-33â€ˆ550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16â€ˆ170 AU/mL [10â€ˆ233-40â€ˆ353], n=26; and â‰¥70 years 17â€ˆ561 AU/mL [9705-37â€ˆ796], n=47; p=0Â·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and â‰¥70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0Â·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (&gt;99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and â‰¥70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose.

The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or â‰¥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 Î¼g or 100 Î¼g of vaccine administered 28 days apart.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-Î¼g dose, the anti-S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-Î¼g dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-Î¼g dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-Î¼g dose, which supports the use of the 100-Î¼g dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, &lt;10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable - e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RANDOMISATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""BLINDING (MASKING)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">This trial is open-label.

The entry of the virus into cells depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although there is currently no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2<sup>1-5</sup>. Here we report on 149 COVID-19-convalescent individuals. Plasma samples collected an average of 39Â days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres; titres were less than 50 in 33% of samples, below 1,000 in 79% of samples and only 1% of samples had titres above 5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed the expansion of clones of RBD-specific memory B cells that expressed closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on the RBD neutralized the virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub> values) as low as 2Â ngÂ ml<sup>-1</sup>. In conclusion, most convalescent plasma samples obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.</AbstractText>",NCT04700163,Registry,1/11/2021,3/31/2022,Interventional,RU Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) mAbs in Healthy Volunteers,"Active, not recruiting",Phase 1,Rockefeller University,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555388,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04700163,0,1,1,1,82495894,United States,0,4,C144-LS and C-135-LS,0,3.02

Many COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic or experience moderate symptoms and recover without medical intervention. However, older people and those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or heart disease are at higher risk of mortality. Because current therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients are limited specifically for this elderly population at risk, Biophytis is developing BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone, a Mas receptor activator) as a new treatment option for managing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the severe stage. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 spike protein seems to alter the function of ACE2, a key player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The clinical picture of COVID-19 includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiomyopathy, multiorgan dysfunction and shock, all of which might result from an imbalance of the RAS. We propose that RAS balance could be restored in COVID-19 patients through MasR activation downstream of ACE2 activity, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) a non-peptidic Mas receptor (MasR) activator. Indeed, MasR activation by 20-hydroxyecdysone harbours anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-fibrotic properties. BIO101, a 97% pharmaceutical grade 20-hydroxyecdysone could then offer a new therapeutic option by improving the respiratory function and ultimately promoting survival in COVID-19 patients that develop severe forms of this devastating disease. Therefore, the objective of this COVA study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIO101, whose active principle is 20-hydroxyecdysone, in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, group sequential and adaptive which will be conducted in 2 parts.

Given social distancing and precipitous evolution of the pandemic, Internet enabled recruitment was deemed the best method to engage a community-based sample. We quantify the efficiency and acceptability of this Internet-based recruitment for engaging a trial cohort and describe the approach used for implementing a health-related trial entirely online using off-the-shelf tools. <b>Methods:</b> We recruited 1,971 adult participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) via engagement with community partners and organizations and outreach through direct and social media messaging. We quantified response rate and participant characteristics of our sample, examine sample representativeness, and evaluate potential non-response bias. <b>Results:</b> Recruitment was similarly derived from direct referral from partner organizations and broader social media based outreach, with extremely low study entry from organic (non-invited) search activity. Of social media platforms, Facebook was the highest yield recruitment source. Bot activity was present but minimal and identifiable through meta-data and engagement behavior. Recruited participants differed from broader populations in terms of sex, ethnicity, and education, but had similar prevalence of chronic conditions.

As of May 27th, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 340,000 deaths worldwide, with 100,000 deaths in the US alone. It is imperative to study and develop pharmacological treatments suitable for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Ascorbic acid is a crucial vitamin necessary for the correct functioning of the immune system. It plays a role in stress response and has shown promising results when administered to the critically ill. Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the current context of a global health pandemic. We present the current evidence for the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Colunga Biancatelli, Berrill, Catravas and Marik.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04578158,Registry,9/29/2020,3/28/2021,Interventional,Trial to Study the Adjuvant Benefits of Quercetin Phytosome in Patients With COVID-19,Completed,Phase 3,Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32636851,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04578158,0,3,3,0,NA,Pakistan,0,9,Standard COVID-19 care|Quercetin Phytosome,0,3.0086

Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly grew by several thousand per day. Less than 100Â days later, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading viral outbreak had become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms. It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate. Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease. Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC's impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease. The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe. There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments. Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19. This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.</AbstractText>",NCT04486001,Registry,12/15/2020,1/15/2022,Interventional,Study of Intravenous Administration of Allogeneic Adipose Stem Cells for COVID-19,Recruiting,Phase 1,"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32423449,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04486001,0,1,1,1,77398293,United States,0,4,PSC-04,0,2.985

In the Intention-To-Treat population, IFNÎ²1a was associated with a significant difference against the control group, in the TTCI; (HR; 2.36, 95% CI 1.10-5.17, P-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.031) while the IFNÎ²1b indicated no significant difference compared with the control; HR; 1.42, (95% CI 0.63-3.16, P-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.395). The median TTCI for both of the intervention groups was five days vs. seven days for the control group. The mortality was numerically lower in both of the intervention groups (20% in the IFNÎ²1a group and 30% in the IFNÎ²1b group vs. 45% in the control group). There were no significant differences between the three arms regarding the adverse events. In patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared with the base therapeutic regiment, the benefit of a significant reduction in TTCI was observed in the IFNÎ²1a arm. This finding needs further confirmation in larger studies.Trial Registration Number: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04343768.

One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFNÎ²-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFNÎ²-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48â€‰h apart, for a total of 2Â weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFNÎ²-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFNÎ²-1a in COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFNÎ²-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease.

However, there is a lack of effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains. Naturally existing compounds provide a wealth of chemical diversity, including antiviral activity, and thus may have utility as therapeutic agents against coronaviral infections. The PubMed database was searched for papers including the keywords coronavirus, SARS or MERS, as well as traditional medicine, herbal, remedy or plants, with 55 primary research articles identified. The overwhelming majority of publications focussed on polar compounds. Compounds that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B<sub>2</sub>, quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, and lectins such as griffithsin. Other compounds such as lycorine may be suitable if a therapeutic level of antiviral activity can be achieved without exceeding toxic plasma concentrations.

Treatments are urgently sought. Adaptations to traditional trial logistics and design to allow rapid implementation, evaluation of trials within a global trials context, flexible interim monitoring, and access outside traditional research hospitals (even in settings where formal placebos are unavailable) may be helpful. Thoughtful adaptations to traditional trial designs, especially within the global context of related studies, may also foster collaborative relationships among government, community, and the research enterprise. Here, we describe the protocol for a pragmatic, active comparator trial in as many as 300 patients comparing two current ""off-label"" treatments for COVID-19-hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin-in academic and nonacademic hospitals in Utah. We developed the trial in response to local pressures for widespread, indiscriminate off-label use of these medications. We used a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist design for interim monitoring to allow rapid, contextual assessment of the available evidence. We also developed an inference grid for interpreting the range of possible results from this trial within the context of parallel trials and prepared for a network meta-analysis of the resulting data.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

The pandemic has led to a rush to repurpose existing drugs, although the underlying evidence base is of variable quality. The improving knowledge of the virology and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is leading to a broadening pool of potential pharmacological targets. The aim of this review is to describe regulatory and pharmacological aspects of drug repurposing and to identify drugs proposed for repurposing in COVID-19 based on registered clinical trials, discussing the evidence to support their use in the treatment of this disease. The challenges of the correct interpretation of existing pre-clinical/clinical evidence as well as the generation of new evidence concerning drug repurposing in COVID-19 will also be discussed. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04321174, NCT04342663, NCT04280705, NCT04244591, NCT04359329, NCT04348695, NCT04304313, NCT043505931.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Sultana, Crisafulli, Gabbay, Lynn, Shakir and TrifirÃ².</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04321174,Abstract,4/17/2020,3/31/2021,Interventional,COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial With Lopinavir/Ritonavir,Recruiting,Phase 3,"St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33240091,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04321174,2,0,2,0,NA,Canada,0,1,Lopinavir/ritonavir,0,2.5978

Participants were asked to take two inhalations twice a day until symptom resolution. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, including emergency department assessment or hospitalisation, analysed for both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. The secondary outcomes were self-reported clinical recovery (symptom resolution), viral symptoms measured using the Common Cold Questionnare (CCQ) and the InFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire (FLUPro), body temperature, blood oxygen saturations, and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416399.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">From July 16 to Dec 9, 2020, 167 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 21 did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. 146 participants were randomly assigned-73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide. For the per-protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in ten (14%) of 70 participants in the usual care group and one (1%) of 69 participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0Â·131, 95% CI 0Â·043 to 0Â·218; p=0Â·004). For the ITT population, the primary outcome occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the usual care group and two (3%) participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0Â·123, 95% CI 0Â·033 to 0Â·213; p=0Â·009). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was eight. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (median 7 days [95% CI 6 to 9] in the budesonide group vs 8 days [7 to 11] in the usual care group; log-rank test p=0Â·007). The mean proportion of days with a fever in the first 14 days was lower in the budesonide group (2%, SD 6) than the usual care group (8%, SD 18; Wilcoxon test p=0Â·051) and the proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide group when compared with the usual care group. As-needed antipyretic medication was required for fewer proportion of days in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (27% [IQR 0-50] vs 50% [15-71]; p=0Â·025) Fewer participants randomly assigned to budesonide had persistent symptoms at days 14 and 28 compared with participants receiving usual care (difference in proportions 0Â·204, 95% CI 0Â·075 to 0Â·334; p=0Â·003). The mean total score change in the CCQ and FLUPro over 14 days was significantly better in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (CCQ mean difference -0Â·12, 95% CI -0Â·21 to -0Â·02 [p=0Â·016]; FLUPro mean difference -0Â·10, 95% CI -0Â·21 to -0Â·00 [p=0Â·044]). Blood oxygen saturations and SARS-CoV-2 load, measured by cycle threshold, were not different between the groups. Budesonide was safe, with only five (7%) participants reporting self-limiting adverse events.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Early administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery after early COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre and AstraZeneca.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

33110944,Journal Article, , ,A multi centre randomized open label trial of chloroquine for the treatment of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vietnam.,10/29/2020,Wellcome open research,"<AbstractText><b>Background</b>: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate chloroquine as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of hospitalised people with COVID-19. We hypothesise that chloroquine slows viral replication in patients with COVID-19, attenuating the infection, and resulting in more rapid decline of viral load in throat/nose swabs. This viral attenuation should be associated with improved patient outcomes. <b>Method</b>: The study will start with a 10-patient prospective observational pilot study following the same entry and exclusion criteria as for the randomized trial and undergoing the same procedures. The main study is an open label, randomised, controlled trial with two parallel arms of standard of care (control arm) versus standard of care with 10 days of chloroquine (intervention arm) with a loading dose over the first 24 hours, followed by 300mg base orally once daily for nine days. The study will recruit patients in three sites in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Cu Chi Field Hospital, and the Can Gio COVID hospital. The primary endpoint is the time to viral clearance from throat/nose swab, defined as the time following randomization until the midpoint between the last positive and the first of the negative throat/nose swabs. Viral presence will be determined using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. <b>Discussion:</b>Â The results of the study will add to the evidence-based guidelines for management of COVID-19. Given the enormous experience of its use in malaria chemoprophylaxis, excellent safety and tolerability profile, and its very low cost, if proved effective then chloroquine would be a readily deployable and affordable treatment for patients with COVID-19. <b>Trial registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04328493 31/03/2020.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: Â© 2020 Kestelyn E et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04328493,Abstract,4/7/2020,9/10/2020,Interventional,The Vietnam Chloroquine Treatment on COVID-19,Completed,Phase 2,"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Vietnam",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33110944,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328493,1,0,1,0,NA,Vietnam,0,4,Chloroquine phosphate,0,2.5852

Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane SÂ glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD 'down', one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4<sup>+</sup> and IFNÎ³<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2Ã— that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phaseÂ I trials in Germany and the USA<sup>1-3</sup>, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phaseÂ II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728).</AbstractText>",NCT04380701,Abstract,4/23/2020,4/30/2023,Interventional,A Trial Investigating the Safety and Effects of Four BNT162 Vaccines Against COVID-2019 in Healthy and Immunocompromised Adults,Recruiting,Phase 1/Phase 2,BioNTech SE,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33524990,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04380701,1,0,1,0,NA,Germany,0,5,BNT162a1|BNT162b1|BNT162b2|BNT162c2,1,2.584

The trial included patients hospitalized within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset, presenting risk factors for illness progression and not on mechanical ventilation. The intervention consisted of immediate CP (early plasma group) versus no CP unless developing prespecified criteria of deterioration (deferred plasma group). Additional standard treatment was allowed in both arms. The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for &gt;14 days, or death. The key secondary outcomes included time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR clearance rate. Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years; 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial. A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation. We failed to find benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% versus 33.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.32-2.84, p &gt; 0.999) in the early versus deferred CP group.

The viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% versus 8%, p = 0.204) and day 7 (38% versus 19%, p = 0.374) did not differ between groups. Two patients experienced serious adverse events within 6 hours after plasma transfusion. The main limitation of this study is the lack of statistical power to detect a smaller but clinically relevant therapeutic effect of CP, as well as not having confirmed neutralizing antibodies in donor before plasma infusion.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In the present study, we failed to find evidence of benefit in mortality, length of hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation requirement by immediate addition of CP therapy in the early stages of COVID-19 compared to its use only in case of patient deterioration.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">NCT04375098.</AbstractText>",NCT04375098,Abstract,5/4/2020,8/17/2020,Interventional,Efficacy and Safety of Early COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Patients Admitted for COVID-19 Infection,Completed,Phase 2,Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33657114,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04375098,1,0,1,0,NA,Chile,0,3,COVID-19 convalescent plasma,0,2.572
33215159,Journal Article, , ,Potential Role of Oral Rinses Targeting the Viral Lipid Envelope in SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,4/28/2021,"Function (Oxford, England)","<AbstractText>Emerging studies increasingly demonstrate the importance of the throat and salivary glands as sites of virus replication and transmission in early COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, characterized by an outer lipid membrane derived from the host cell from which it buds. While it is highly sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid biomembranes, there has been no discussion about the potential role of oral rinsing in preventing transmission. Here, we review known mechanisms of viral lipid membrane disruption by widely available dental mouthwash components that include ethanol, chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone-iodine. We also assess existing formulations for their potential ability to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope, based on their concentrations of these agents, and conclude that several deserve clinical evaluation. We highlight that already published research on other enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, directly supports the idea that oral rinsing should be considered as a potential way to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Research to test this could include evaluating existing or specifically tailored new formulations in well-designed viral inactivation assays, then in clinical trials. Population-based interventions could be undertaken with available mouthwashes, with active monitoring of outcome to determine efficacy. This is an under-researched area of major clinical need.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.

As COVID-19 has proven to be a moving target as far as its management is concerned, we will use current definitions according to the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. All CP recipients will receive supportive management including all available recommended therapies according to the available MOH guidelines. Eligible CP donors will be patients with COVID-19 who have fully recovered from their disease according to MOH recovery criteria as detailed in the inclusion criteria. CP donors have to qualify as blood donors according to MOH regulations except for the history of COVID-19 in the recent past. We will also test the CP donors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a rapid test, and aliquots will be archived for future antibody titration. Due to the perceived benefit of CP, randomization was not considered. However, we will compare the outcome of the cohort treated with CP with those who did not receive CP due to a lack of consent or lack of availability. In this national collaborative study, there is a likelihood of not finding exactly matched control group patients. Hence, we plan to perform a propensity score matching of the CP recipients with the comparator group patients for the major characteristics. We plan to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of both groups and compare the outcomes. A total sample size of 575 patients, 115 CP recipients and 460 matched controls (1:4 ratio), will be sufficient to detect a clinically important hospital stay and 30-day mortality difference between the two groups with 80% power and a 5% level of significance.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">At present, patient recruitment is still ongoing, and the interim analysis of the first 40 patients will be shared soon.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In this paper, we present a protocol for a national collaborative multicenter phase II study in Saudi Arabia for assessing the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of CP in treating patients with severe COVID-19.

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID<sub>50</sub> of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC<sub>50</sub> values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"<AbstractText>Since SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in December 2019 (1), approximately 1.3 million cases have been reported worldwide (2), including approximately 330,000 in the United States (3). To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged â‰¥50 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged â‰¥65 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)<sup>â€ </sup> to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5). Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.</AbstractText>",NCT04530617,Registry,10/5/2020,6/10/2021,Interventional,Camostat and Artemisia Annua vs Placebo in COVID-19 Outpatients,Terminated,Phase 2,Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran,Results from the interim analysis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32298251,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04530617,0,25,25,0,NA,Mexico,0,5,Camostat Mesilate|Artemisia Annua Leaf,0,2.561

Hydrogen peroxide is produced physiologically by oral bacteria and plays a significant role in the balance of oral microecology since it is an important antimicrobial agent. In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide. The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-ÎºB. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections and help protect against the current coronavirus pandemic. We strongly encourage the rapid development of randomized controlled trials in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects to test the preliminary findings from the in-vitro and in-vivo observational studies that we identified.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission. If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain Î²-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2Â·2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever â‰¥37Â·8Â°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24â€ˆ422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17â€ˆ178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66Â·7% (95% CI 57Â·4-74Â·0), with 84 (1Â·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2Â·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0Â·9%) of 12â€ˆ282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1Â·1%) of 11â€ˆ962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76Â·0% (59Â·3-85Â·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0Â·66 [95% CI 0Â·59-0Â·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81Â·3% [95% CI 60Â·3-91Â·2] at â‰¥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55Â·1% [33Â·0-69Â·9] at &lt;6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 2Â·32 [2Â·01-2Â·68]).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemann Foundation, Rede D'Or, the Brava and Telles Foundation, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; nâ€‰=â€‰20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; nâ€‰=â€‰32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56â€‰d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; nâ€‰=â€‰10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; nâ€‰=â€‰10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.</AbstractText>",NCT04324606,Abstract,4/23/2020,10/31/2021,Interventional,A Study of a Candidate COVID-19 Vaccine (COV001),"Active, not recruiting",Phase 1/Phase 2,University of Oxford,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33335322,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324606,3,0,3,0,NA,United Kingdom,0,14,ChAdOx1 nCoV-19|MenACWY|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 full boost|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 half boost|MenACWY boost|Paracetamol|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL boost|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL (3.5-6.5x10^10vp) late vaccine (LV)|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL (3.5-6.5x10^10vp) late vaccine two (LVT),1,2.5505

We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon lambda in the treatment of outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 Î¼g or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation list created with a randomisation schedule in blocks of four. At the time of administration, study nurses received a sealed opaque envelope with the treatment allocation number. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on day 7 after the injection, analysed by a Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test following an intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, adjusted for baseline viral load, using bivariate logistic regression was done. The trial is now complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354259.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between May 18, and Sept 4, 2020, we recruited 30 patients per group. The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2Â·42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0Â·0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0Â·15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4Â·12 [95% CI 1Â·15-16Â·73; p=0Â·029). Of those with baseline viral load above 10<sup>6</sup> copies per mL, 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the peginterferon lambda group had undetectable virus on day 7, compared with six (38%) of 16 in the placebo group (OR 6Â·25 [95% CI 1Â·49-31Â·06]; p=0Â·012). Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group. Two individuals met the threshold of grade 3 increase, one in each group, and no other grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were reported.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Peginterferon lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19, increasing the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, particularly in those with high baseline viral load.

The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions. Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission. Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice.

Forty-six (nâ€‰=â€‰33,900; 70 drug compactor arms) trials were pooled, yielding only three approved drugs. Twenty-two (31.4%) drug-placebo comparisons were successful. Numerically, success rates for treatment arms from studies with one versus more than one drug-placebo comparison were higher (39.3% versus 26.2%). The antidepressant lead-in employing single-blind placebo and the sequential-parallel comparison design (SPCD) were successful in 50% and 40% of cases, respectively. The direct randomization (no lead-in) design yielded positive results in one third of cases. The success rate of open-label antidepressant lead-ins without placebo or using double-blind placebo was very poor (&lt;15%). There was also a pronounced discrepancy in terms of efficiency across study designs. Accounting for sample size requirements, a phase 3 program using SPCD would have a higher cumulative chance of yielding two positive trials (50%) than a phase 3 program using a single-blind placebo lead-in (40%). Future programs should carefully weigh the need for a lead-in, which is time-consuming, expensive and, in some cases (i.e., open-label antidepressant without placebo or with double-blind placebo) nearly futile.

Imatinib can be dissolved in water or apple juice for patients having difficulty swallowing. In this study, patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 tests receive imatinib for a total of 14 days; 400 mg orally daily Days 1-14. Imatinib 400 mg tablets will be encapsulated using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, imatinib will be given as oral suspension (40 mg/mL). To make the oral suspension, imatinib tablets will be crushed and mixed in Ora-sweet solution to yield a concentration of 40 mg/mL suspension by pharmacy. Additionally, in the absence of supportive microbiological testing results, we confirm that the in-use stability period for the prepared imatinib suspensions will be 24 hours at room temperature or 7 days at refrigerated conditions. The pharmacy staff will follow the American Society Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines for handling hazardous drugs. Placebo: The matching placebo will be packaged by Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy at University of Maryland Medical Center. The placebos will be prepared using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. Concomitant Medications/supportive care: In both arms, patients can receive concomitant available local standard of care antipyretics, antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals and anti-inflammatory including hydroxychloroquine at the discretion of the treating physician as necessary. For other drug-drug interactions particularly with CYP P450, the treating physician should consider the risk and benefit of drug administration based on available information. Co-administration of off-label immunomodulatory treatments for COVID-19 including but not limited to corticosteroids, sarilumab, clazakizumab, tocilizumab, and anakinra will be allowed but may affect interpretability of study outcomes. The timing, dosing, and duration of these treatments will be meticulously collected, including any of these treatments that may be used for participants who experience progression of COVID-19 disease after study enrollment. Two analyses will be performed, the primary analysis will compare the primary endpoint in the two trial arms irrespective of any other treatment; the second analysis will be stratified for co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a two-point improvement at Day 14 from baseline using the 8-category ordinal scale. The ordinal scale is an evaluation of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8) Death. The secondary endpoints include: All-cause mortality at Day 28, All-cause mortality at Day 60, Time to a 2-point clinical improvement difference over baseline, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of ECMO or invasive mechanical ventilation (for subjects who are on ECMO or mechanical ventilation at Day 1), Duration of ICU stay (for subjects who are in ICU at Day 1), Time to SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR, Proportion of patients with negative oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after starting treatment, Proportion of subjects with serious adverse events, Proportion of subjects who discontinue study drug due to adverse events. The exploratory endpoints include: Determine the impact of treatment arms on IL-6 levels, Obtain blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for storage to look at transcriptomics in severe disease, Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severity of illness, Mean change in the ordinal scale from baseline, Time to an improvement of one category from admission using an ordinal scale, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of new oxygen use, Number of oxygenation free days, Duration of new mechanical ventilation, Number of ventilator free days.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RANDOMIZATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Eligible patients will be uniformly randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either imatinib or placebo for 14 days.

Patients in both arms will receive the BCC per local institutional standards at the discretion of the treating physician. Group sample sizes of 102 in Arm A and 102 in Arm B achieve 80.6% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.20. The proportion in Arm A (imatinib treatment arm) is assumed to be 0.30 under the null hypothesis and 0.50 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Arm B (placebo control arm) is 0.30. The test statistic used is the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test. The significance level of the test is targeted at 0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this design is Î±=0.0385. The power of the test is calculated using binomial enumeration of all possible outcomes. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention to treat principle (ITT) for participants who at least receive one dose of study drug or placebo. The sample size is not inflated for dropouts.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b<sup>mid</sup> regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-Î± was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2<sup>-</sup> and TMPRSS2<sup>-</sup> which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: Â© 2020 Leng et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04361942,Registry,5/1/2020,11/30/2021,Interventional,Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia With Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (COVID_MSV),Recruiting,Phase 2,Red de Terapia Celular,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257537,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04361942,0,4,4,0,NA,Spain,0,3,Mesenchymal Stromal Cells|Placebo,0,2.5335

We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage, based on our phase 1 data. In this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage. They were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either UC-MSCs (4â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>7</sup> cells per infusion) or placebo on day 0, 3, and 6. The primary endpoint was an altered proportion of whole lung lesion volumes from baseline to day 28. Other imaging outcomes, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and adverse events were recorded and analyzed. In all, 100 COVID-19 patients were finally received either UC-MSCs (nâ€‰=â€‰65) or placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰35). UC-MSCs administration exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (the median difference was -13.31%, 95% CI -29.14%, 2.13%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.080). UC-MSCs significantly reduced the proportions of solid component lesion volume compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%; 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). The 6-MWT showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00â€‰m; 95% CI 0.00, 57.00; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that UC-MSCs treatment is a safe and potentially effective therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with lung damage.

Median age was 49Â·0 years (IQR 41Â·0-58Â·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8Â·0 days [IQR 5Â·0-13Â·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFÎ±.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.

25309825,Journal Article, , ,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Neuropathic Pain.,10/1/2020,Journal of pain &amp; relief,"<AbstractText>Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common problems contributing to suffering and disability worldwide. Unfortunately, NP is also largely refractory to treatments, with a large number of patients continuing to report significant pain even when they are receiving recommended medications and physical therapy. Thus, there remains an urgent need for additional effective treatments. In recent years, nonpharmacologic brain stimulation techniques have emerged as potential therapeutic options. Many of these techniques and procedures - such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and motor cortical stimulation - have very limited availability, particularly in developing countries. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation procedure that has shown promise for effectively treating NP, and also has the potential to be widely available. This review describes tDCS and the tDCS procedures and principles that may be helpful for treating NP. The findings indicate that the analgesic benefits of tDCS can occur both during stimulation and beyond the time of stimulation. The mechanisms of cortical modulation by tDCS may involve various activities in neuronal networks such as increasing glutamine and glutamate under the stimulating electrode, effects on the Î¼-opioid receptor, and restoration of the defective intracortical inhibition. Additional research is needed to determine (1) the factors that may moderate the efficacy of tDCS, (2) the dose (e.g. number and frequency of treatment sessions) that results in the largest benefits and (3) the long-term effects of tDCS treatment.</AbstractText>",NCT04780152,Registry,10/31/2021,8/31/2022,Interventional,TDCS in Pediatric and Teenage Patients With Major Depressive Disorder During COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,Phase 2/Phase 3,El Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia Manuel Velasco Suarez,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25309825,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780152,0,57,57,0,NA,Mexico,0,2,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|Placebo-simulation of transcranial direct current stimulation|Fluoxetine Tablets,0,2.5221
29213226,Journal Article, , ,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): A Beginner's Guide for Design and Implementation.,10/1/2020,Frontiers in neuroscience,"<AbstractText>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a popular brain stimulation method that is used to modulate cortical excitability, producing facilitatory or inhibitory effects upon a variety of behaviors. There is, however, a current lack of consensus between studies, with many results suggesting that polarity-specific effects are difficult to obtain. This article explores some of these differences and highlights the experimental parameters that may underlie their occurrence. We provide a general, practical snapshot of tDCS methodology, including what it is used for, how to use it, and considerations for designing an effective and safe experiment. Our aim is to equip researchers who are new to tDCS with the essential knowledge so that they can make informed and well-rounded decisions when designing and running successful experiments. By summarizing the varied approaches, stimulation parameters, and outcomes, this article should help inform future tDCS research in a variety of fields.</AbstractText>",NCT04780152,Registry,10/31/2021,8/31/2022,Interventional,TDCS in Pediatric and Teenage Patients With Major Depressive Disorder During COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,Phase 2/Phase 3,El Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia Manuel Velasco Suarez,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29213226,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780152,0,57,57,0,NA,Mexico,0,2,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|Placebo-simulation of transcranial direct current stimulation|Fluoxetine Tablets,0,2.5221

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (â‰¥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1Â·10, 95% CI 1Â·03-1Â·17, per year increase; p=0Â·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5Â·65, 2Â·61-12Â·23; p&lt;0Â·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 Î¼g/mL (18Â·42, 2Â·64-128Â·55; p=0Â·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20Â·0 days (IQR 17Â·0-24Â·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 Î¼g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Is fluoxetine an effective treatment of depression in this population, and how long should she expect to wait before noticing an effect?<b>Answer</b> For depression in children and adolescents, fluoxetine has the most evidence for efficacy when compared with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; however, it is not approved by Health Canada for this patient population. Available evidence has shown that most of its clinical benefit is seen within the first 2 weeks. Lack of response by week 4 might suggest a need for reevaluation. However, more research is needed to elucidate the optimal length of the initial treatment period. There is conflicting evidence regarding the risk of suicidality in this population, so close patient monitoring is required when using fluoxetine in children and adolescents.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>CopyrightÂ© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04780152,Registry,10/31/2021,8/31/2022,Interventional,TDCS in Pediatric and Teenage Patients With Major Depressive Disorder During COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,Phase 2/Phase 3,El Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia Manuel Velasco Suarez,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413023,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780152,0,57,57,0,NA,Mexico,0,2,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|Placebo-simulation of transcranial direct current stimulation|Fluoxetine Tablets,0,2.5216

Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 Î¼g with Algel-IMDG or 6 Î¼g with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) and the microneutralisation test (MNT<sub>50</sub>). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104).

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18Â years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.</AbstractText>",NCT04780152,Registry,10/31/2021,8/31/2022,Interventional,TDCS in Pediatric and Teenage Patients With Major Depressive Disorder During COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,Phase 2/Phase 3,El Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia Manuel Velasco Suarez,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32363492,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780152,0,57,57,0,NA,Mexico,0,2,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|Placebo-simulation of transcranial direct current stimulation|Fluoxetine Tablets,0,2.5165

These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17Â·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16Â·9-19Â·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24Â·7 days (22Â·9-28Â·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70â€ˆ117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3Â·67% (95% CrI 3Â·56-3Â·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1Â·38% (1Â·23-1Â·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0Â·32% [0Â·27-0Â·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6Â·4% [5Â·7-7Â·2] in those aged â‰¥60 years), up to 13Â·4% (11Â·2-15Â·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1Â·4% [0Â·4-3Â·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4Â·5% [1Â·8-11Â·1] in those aged â‰¥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0Â·66% (0Â·39-1Â·33), with an increasing profile with age.

Biomarkers are indicators of physiological, pathological processes or of pharmacological response to therapeutic interventions. They can be used for diagnosis, risk-stratification, prediction and monitoring of treatment response. To better delineate the input and pitfalls of biomarkers in ILDs, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature in MEDLINE and Embase databases from January 1960 to February 2019. We focused on circulating biomarkers as having the highest generalizability. Overall, 70 studies were included in the review and 20 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. This review highlights that ILD associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD-ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) share common biomarkers, suggesting common pathophysiological pathways. KL-6 and SP-D, could diagnose lung fibrosis in both IPF and CTD-ILD, with KL-6 having the strongest value (OR: 520.95[110.07-2465.58], p&lt;0.001 in IPF and OR:26.43[7.15-97.68], p&lt;0.001 in CTD-ILD), followed by SPD (OR: 33.81[3.20-357.52], pÂ =Â 0.003 in IPF and 13.24 [3.84-45.71] in SSc-ILD), MMP7 appeared as interesting for IPF diagnosis (p&lt;0.001), whereas in SSc, CCL18 was associated with ILD diagnosis. Both CCL18 and KL-6 were predictive for the outcomes of ILDs, with higher predictive values for CCL18 in both IPF (OR:10.22[4.72-22.16], p&lt;0.001 and in SSc [2.62[1.71-4.03], p&lt;0.001). However, disease specific biomarkers are lacking and large longitudinal studies are needed before the translational use of the potential biomarkers in clinical practice. With the recent availability of new effective therapies in ILDs, further studies should assess response to treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (â‰¥39 Â°C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Conclusions and Relevance"">Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.</AbstractText>",NCT04432103,Registry,8/8/2020,1/29/2021,Interventional,Treatment of Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia With Convalescent Plasma,Terminated,Phase 3,Centro Medico ABC,"There is new evidence that the Convalescent plasma is not useful for severe and critical

Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b<sup>mid</sup> regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-Î± was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2<sup>-</sup> and TMPRSS2<sup>-</sup> which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection.

However, less is known about transmission in schools for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who are often unable to mask or maintain social distancing. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 positivity and in-school transmission rates using weekly screening tests for school staff and students and describe the concurrent deployment of mitigation strategies in six schools for children with IDD.METHODSFrom 11/23/20 to 5/28/21, weekly voluntary screening for SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity molecular-based saliva test was offered to school staff and students. Weekly positivity rates were determined and compared to local healthcare system and undergraduate student screening data. School-based transmission was assessed among participants quarantined for in-school exposure. School administrators completed a standardized survey to assess school mitigation strategies.RESULTSA total of 59 students and 416 staff participated. An average of 304 school staff and students were tested per week. Of 7,289 tests performed, 21 (0.29%) new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. The highest weekly positivity rate was 1.2% (nâ€‰=â€‰4) across all schools, which was less than community positivity rates. Two cases of in-school transmission were identified, each among staff, representing 2% (2/103) of participants quarantined for in-school exposure. Mitigation strategies included higher than expected student mask compliance, reduced room capacity, and phased reopening.CONCLUSIONSDuring 24 weeks that included the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found no evidence for elevated SARS-CoV-2 screening test positivity among staff and students of six schools for children with IDD compared to community rates. In-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low among those quarantined for in-school exposure.Clinical Trial RegistryPrior to enrollment, this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 9/25/2020, identifier NCT04565509, titled Supporting the Health and Well-being of Children with Intellectual and Developmental Disability During COVID-19 Pandemic (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04565509?term=NCT04565509).</AbstractText>",NCT04565509,Abstract,11/20/2020,6/30/2022,Interventional,Supporting the Health and Well-being of Children With Intellectual and Developmental Disability During COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,N/A,Washington University School of Medicine,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34312616,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04565509,1,0,1,1,82796249,United States,0,2,General Communication Message|Focused/Targeted Message|Best Message Alone|Best Message + Augmented Message or Implementation Strategy,0,2.5092

The combined hypo- and hyper-reward responses results in a reward imbalance, which has been noted as a relevant maintenance factor for eating disorders (EDs) characterized by binge eating. This registered report describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing supportive therapy to a novel treatment targeting reward imbalance (Reward Re-Training; RRT) for individuals with binge eating. Aims of the current study include to confirm feasibility and acceptability of RRT, to evaluate the ability of RRT to engage critical targets, and to provide preliminary estimates of efficacy in reducing ED symptoms at both posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Sixty participants will be randomized to either RRT or supportive therapy. For both conditions, treatment will be delivered in 10 weekly group outpatient therapy sessions conducted remotely using videoconferencing software. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up to measure feasibility, acceptability, critical treatment targets (i.e., reward to day-to-day life activities, reward to palatable foods, social isolation, and loneliness), and ED symptoms.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04661410,Abstract,12/1/2020,12/1/2021,Interventional,Reward Re-Training: A New Treatment to Address Reward Imbalance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Recruiting,N/A,Drexel University,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33908655,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04661410,1,0,1,1,74760964,United States,0,1,Reward Re-Training|Supportive Therapy,0,2.5082

More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help.

We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure.

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, including evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow, and proposed clinical trials, as scale-up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource.</AbstractText>",NCT04432103,Registry,8/8/2020,1/29/2021,Interventional,Treatment of Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia With Convalescent Plasma,Terminated,Phase 3,Centro Medico ABC,"There is new evidence that the Convalescent plasma is not useful for severe and critical

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 Ã— 10<sup>9</sup>/L vs. 0.76 Ã— 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.</AbstractText>",NCT04610541,Registry,10/12/2020,10/30/2021,Interventional,REMdesivir-HU Clinical Study and Severe Covid-19 Patients,"Active, not recruiting",Phase 3,University of Pecs,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32054787,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04610541,0,6,6,0,NA,Hungary,0,1,Remdesivir-HU,0,2.5014

Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.

Metagenomic RNA sequencing<sup>4</sup> of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903Â nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China<sup>5</sup>.

The primary objective of this scoping review is to synthesize current research of the diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), immunology tests, and computed tomography (CT) for the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of COVID-19.

Patients without COVID-19 are rarely reported, so specificity and likelihood ratios were generally unavailable. Fever is the most common finding, while hyposmia and hypogeusia appear useful to rule in COVID-19. Cough is not consistently present. Lymphopenia is the mostly commonly reported laboratory abnormality and occurs in over 50% of COVID-19 patients. rRT-PCR is currently considered the COVID-19 criterion standard for most diagnostic studies, but a single test sensitivity ranges from 60% to 78%. Multiple reasons for false-negatives rRT-PCR exist, including sample site tested and disease stage during which sample was obtained. CT may increase COVID-19 sensitivity in conjunction with rRT-PCR, but guidelines for imaging patients most likely to benefit are emerging. IgM and IgG serology levels are undetectable in the first week of COVID-19, but sensitivity (rangeÂ = 82% to 100%) and specificity (rangeÂ = 87% to 100%) are promising. Whether detectable COVID-19 antibodies correspond to immunity remains unanswered. Current studies do not adhere to accepted diagnostic accuracy reporting standards and likely report significantly biased results if the same tests were to be applied to general ED populations with suspected COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">With the exception of fever and disorders of smell/taste, history and physical examination findings are unhelpful to distinguish COVID-19 from other infectious conditions that mimic SARS-CoV-2 like influenza. Routine laboratory tests are also nondiagnostic, although lymphopenia is a common finding and other abnormalities may predict severe disease. Although rRT-PCR is the current criterion standard, more inclusive consensus-based criteria will likely emerge because of the high false-negative rate of PCR tests. The role of serology and CT in ED assessments remains undefined.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04568356,Registry,4/24/2020,6/12/2020,Interventional,A Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Rapid Point of Care Antigen Tests,Completed,N/A,"E25Bio, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32542934,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04568356,0,16,16,1,74778417,United States,0,1,Direct Antigen Tests for COVID-19,0,2.4965

During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals' adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups.

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large and there is still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker that can effectively block the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and thus is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020.

In the current pandemic, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients and 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 uninfected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the performance of the antigen test with that of RT-qPCR. We also compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. Using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity, with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with &gt; 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline, along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

Foremost among these are migraine, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome, disorders that may overlap in their affected populations and whose sufferers have all endured the stigma of a psychosomatic label, as well as the failure of endless pharmacotherapeutic interventions with substandard benefit. The commonality in symptomatology in these conditions displaying hyperalgesia and central sensitization with possible common underlying pathophysiology suggests that a clinical endocannabinoid deficiency might characterize their origin. Its base hypothesis is that all humans have an underlying endocannabinoid tone that is a reflection of levels of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide), and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, their production, metabolism, and the relative abundance and state of cannabinoid receptors. Its theory is that in certain conditions, whether congenital or acquired, endocannabinoid tone becomes deficient and productive of pathophysiological syndromes. When first proposed in 2001 and subsequently, this theory was based on genetic overlap and comorbidity, patterns of symptomatology that could be mediated by the endocannabinoid system (ECS), and the fact that exogenous cannabinoid treatment frequently provided symptomatic benefit. However, objective proof and formal clinical trial data were lacking. Currently, however, statistically significant differences in cerebrospinal fluid anandamide levels have been documented in migraineurs, and advanced imaging studies have demonstrated ECS hypofunction in post-traumatic stress disorder.

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic?</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND FINDINGS"">We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3%-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%-37%, prediction interval 24%-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.</AbstractText>",NCT04568356,Registry,4/24/2020,6/12/2020,Interventional,A Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Rapid Point of Care Antigen Tests,Completed,N/A,"E25Bio, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960881,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04568356,0,16,16,1,74778417,United States,0,1,Direct Antigen Tests for COVID-19,0,2.4919

Although rates of satisfaction with current Calm components were high (65/82, 79%; and 51/81, 63%), only 49% (40/82) of participants used guided meditations that they felt specifically helped with their cancer-related symptoms and survivorship, and 40% (33/82) would prefer more cancer-related content, with guided meditations for cancer-specific anxieties (eg, fear of recurrence; n=15) and coping with strong emotions (n=12) being the most common suggestions. A majority of participants (51/82, 62%) reported that they would be interested in becoming a member of a Calm cancer community (eg, in-app discussion boards: 41/46, 89%; and social media communities: 35/42, 83%). Almost half of the participants (37/82, 45%) reported that they would benefit from features that tracked symptoms in concurrence with app usage, but respondents were divided on whether this information should be shared with health care providers through the app (49/82, 60% would share).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Responses suggest ways in which the current Calm app could be adapted to better fit cancer patients' and survivors' needs and preferences, including adding more cancer-specific content, increasing the amount of content focusing on coping with strong emotions, developing communities for Calm users who are cancer patients and survivors, and including features that track cancer-related symptoms. Given differences in opinions about which features were desirable or would be useful, there is a clear need for future cancer-specific apps to be customizable (eg, ability to turn different features on or off). Although future research should address these topics in larger, more diverse samples, these data will serve as a starting point for the development of cancer-specific meditation app and provide a framework for evaluating their effects.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Jennifer Huberty, Megan Puzia, Ryan Eckert, Linda Larkey.

The tests are intended for use in the field and, longer term, for home use. They detect whether a subject is currently infected with the virus and is infectious. The urgent need for large numbers of tests in field setting imposes constraints such as short test time and lack of access to specialist equipment, laboratories and skilled technicians to perform the test and interpret results. To meet these needs, an antigen test based on RT-LAMP with colorimetric readout was chosen. Direct use of swab sample with no RNA extraction was explored. After extensive experimental study (reported elsewhere), a rapid test kit has been fabricated to satisfy all design criteria.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04568356,Registry,4/24/2020,6/12/2020,Interventional,A Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Rapid Point of Care Antigen Tests,Completed,N/A,"E25Bio, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32395391,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04568356,0,16,16,1,74778417,United States,0,1,Direct Antigen Tests for COVID-19,0,2.4917

The current gold standard is to perform RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of ~100 copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss more infected patients, resulting in more false negatives. However, the false-negative rate for a given LoD remains unknown. Here we address this question using over 27,500 test results for patients from across our healthcare network tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA. These results suggest that each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to increase the false negative rate by 13%, missing an additional one in eight infected patients. The highest LoDs on the market will miss a majority of infected patients, with false negative rates as high as 70%. These results suggest that choice of assay has meaningful clinical and epidemiological consequences.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the demand for accurate, easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective antigen tests for clinical application. We propose a de novo antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 using the combination of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thio-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. Our test takes advantage of the spike proteins specific to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The limit of detection of our test was 2.3 Ã— 10<sup>-18</sup> moles/assay. If the virus has ~25 spike proteins on its surface, our method should detect on the order of 10<sup>-20</sup> moles of virus/assay, corresponding to ~10<sup>4</sup> copies of the virus RNA/assay. The detection sensitivity approaches that of PCR-based assays because the average virus RNA load used for PCR-based assays is ~10<sup>5</sup> copies per oro- or naso-pharyngeal swab specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasensitive antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that can be performed with an easy-to-use microplate reader. Sufficient sensitivity can be achieved within 10 min of thio-NAD cycling. Our antigen test allows for rapid, cost-effective, specific, ultrasensitive, and simultaneous multiple measurements of SARS-CoV-2, and has broad application for the diagnosis for COVID-19.</AbstractText>",NCT04568356,Registry,4/24/2020,6/12/2020,Interventional,A Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Rapid Point of Care Antigen Tests,Completed,N/A,"E25Bio, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32823866,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04568356,0,16,16,1,74778417,United States,0,1,Direct Antigen Tests for COVID-19,0,2.4917

Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify or rule out current infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to laboratory-based diagnostic methods, with the aim of reducing household and community transmission.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has current SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">On 25 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">We included studies of people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results available within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">Two review authors independently screened studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author.

We present sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test using paired forest plots. We pooled data using the bivariate hierarchical model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests, with simplifications when few studies were available. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included 22 publications reporting on a total of 18 study cohorts with 3198 unique samples, of which 1775 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ten studies took place in North America, two in South America, four in Europe, one in China and one was conducted internationally. We identified data for eight commercial tests (four antigen and four molecular) and one in-house antigen test. Five of the studies included were only available as preprints. We did not find any studies at low risk of bias for all quality domains and had concerns about applicability of results across all studies. We judged patient selection to be at high risk of bias in 50% of the studies because of deliberate over-sampling of samples with confirmed COVID-19 infection and unclear in seven out of 18 studies because of poor reporting. Sixteen (89%) studies used only a single, negative RT-PCR to confirm the absence of COVID-19 infection, risking missing infection. There was a lack of information on blinding of index test (n = 11), and around participant exclusions from analyses (n = 10). We did not observe differences in methodological quality between antigen and molecular test evaluations. Antigen tests Sensitivity varied considerably across studies (from 0% to 94%): the average sensitivity was 56.2% (95% CI 29.5 to 79.8%) and average specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.9%; based on 8 evaluations in 5 studies on 943 samples). Data for individual antigen tests were limited with no more than two studies for any test. Rapid molecular assays Sensitivity showed less variation compared to antigen tests (from 68% to 100%), average sensitivity was 95.2% (95% CI 86.7% to 98.3%) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 97.3% to 99.5%) based on 13 evaluations in 11 studies of on 2255 samples. Predicted values based on a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people with suspected COVID-19 infection (with a prevalence of 10%) result in 105 positive test results including 10 false positives (positive predictive value 90%), and 895 negative results including 5 false negatives (negative predictive value 99%). Individual tests We calculated pooled results of individual tests for ID NOW (Abbott Laboratories) (5 evaluations) and Xpert Xpress (Cepheid Inc) (6 evaluations). Summary sensitivity for the Xpert Xpress assay (99.4%, 95% CI 98.0% to 99.8%) was 22.6 (95% CI 18.8 to 26.3) percentage points higher than that of ID NOW (76.8%, (95% CI 72.9% to 80.3%), whilst the specificity of Xpert Xpress (96.8%, 95% CI 90.6% to 99.0%) was marginally lower than ID NOW (99.6%, 95% CI 98.4% to 99.9%; a difference of -2.8% (95% CI -6.4 to 0.8)) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies early-stage evaluations of point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, largely based on remnant laboratory samples. The findings currently have limited applicability, as we are uncertain whether tests will perform in the same way in clinical practice, and according to symptoms of COVID-19, duration of symptoms, or in asymptomatic people. Rapid tests have the potential to be used to inform triage of RT-PCR use, allowing earlier detection of those testing positive, but the evidence currently is not strong enough to determine how useful they are in clinical practice. Prospective and comparative evaluations of rapid tests for COVID-19 infection in clinically relevant settings are urgently needed. Studies should recruit consecutive series of eligible participants, including both those presenting for testing due to symptoms and asymptomatic people who may have come into contact with confirmed cases. Studies should clearly describe symptomatic status and document time from symptom onset or time since exposure. Point-of-care tests must be conducted on samples according to manufacturer instructions for use and be conducted at the point of care. Any future research study report should conform to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guideline.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

IL-6 signaling is mediated by building a complex of IL-6, the transmembrane IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) or with soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R), and the signal-transducing subunit molecule gp130. Therefore, three modes for IL-6 signaling may occur in which IL-6 is binding to mIL-6R (classic), to sIL-6R (trans-signaling), or is joined through IL-6R to gp130 on nearby located cells (trans-presentation). These pathways, and the fact that gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, lead to the pleiotropic functions of IL-6. The control of IL-6 signaling is regulated through the induction of suppressor molecules after activation of the IL-6 pathways as well as through the presence of sIL-6R and gp130 forms in the blood. Vice versa, an overproduction of IL-6 and dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathways can result in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as cancer development suggesting that IL-6 plays a significant role in the human cytokine network. Several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for inhibiting the cytokine itself, the signaling via the IL-6 receptor, or target kinases (e.g., JAK/STAT) associated with the signaling pathways. Amongst others, tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R humanized antibody) has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cytokine release syndrome, and idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease (iMCD), whereas siltuximab (an IL-6 antagonist) received approval for iMCD only. Although not all IL-6-associated diseases respond to IL-6 blockade, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the IL-6 pathways may, therefore, help to find the best treatment for IL-6-associated diseases in the near future.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 S.

Twenty COVID-19 patients received two 200Â ml transfusions of convalescent patient CP over 24-h compared with 20 who received standard of care. The primary outcome was the requirement for ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical ventilation). The secondary outcomes were biochemical parameters and mortality at 28Â days.

High infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is related with cell entry mechanism, through the ACE receptor. SARS-CoV-2 requires transmembrane protease serine 2 to cleave its spike glycoprotein and ensure fusion of host cell and virus membrane. We propose studying prophylactic treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and bromhexine (BHH), which have been shown to be effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection progression when administered in early stages. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of HCQ and BHH as prophylactic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy health workers exposed to the virus.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">Double-blind randomised clinical trial, with parallel allocation at a 1:1 ratio with placebo, of low doses of HCQ plus BHH, for 60 days.

Primary endpoint will be efficacy of both interventions for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by the risk ratio of infected personnel and the absolute risk. At least a 16% reduction in absolute risk is expected between the intervention and placebo groups; a minimum of 20% infection is expected in the placebo group.

The surfactant product is Bovactant (AlveofactÂ®), a natural animal derived (bovine) lung surfactant formulated as a lyophilized powder in 108 mg vials and reconstituted to 45 mg/mL in buffer supplied in a prefilled syringe. It is isolated by lung lavage and, by weight, is a mixture of: phospholipid (75% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 3% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1% phosphatidylinositol and 1% sphingomyelin), 5% cholesterol, 1% lipid-soluble surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B and SP-C), very low levels of free fatty acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, water and 0.3% calcium. The Drug Delivery Device is the AeroFact-COVIDâ„¢ nebulizer, an investigational device based on the AerogenÂ® Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. The timing and escalation dosing plans for the surfactant are as follows. Cohort 1: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 2: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours and 8 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at a dosing time of 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention.

Concurrently, several nutritional therapies and alternative supportive treatments are also being used and tested to reduce the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. In the context of COVID-19, improved nutrition that includes micronutrient supplementation to augment the immune system has been recognized as a viable approach to both prevent and alleviate the severity of the infection. The potential role of micronutrients as immune-boosting agents is particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries, which already have an existing high burden of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. A systematic literature review was performed to identify nutritional interventions that might prevent or aid in the recovery from COVID-19. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched electronically from February to April 2020. All abstracts and full-text articles were examined for their relevance to this review. The information gathered was collated under various categories. Deficiencies of micronutrients, especially vitaminsâ€‰A, B complex, C, and D, zinc, iron, and selenium, are common among vulnerable populations in general and among COVID-19 patients in particular and could plausibly increase the risk of mortality. Judicious use of need-based micronutrient supplementation, alongside existing micronutrient fortification programs, is warranted in the current global pandemic, especially in low- and middle-income economies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.

The monkeys were euthanized, and blood, plasma, urine, feces and ten tissues were collected. All the samples were prepared by protein precipitation and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS detection. The population pharmacokinetics of HCQ in the plasma, red blood cells, and lung tissue was conducted and simulated via ADAPT program. Results demonstrated that the maximum concentration (<i>C</i> <sub>max</sub>) of HCQ was 292.33Â ng/mL in blood and 36.90Â ng/mL in plasma after single dose of 3Â mg/kg. The value of area under curve (AUC<sub>0-âˆž</sub>) was determined as 5,978.94 and 363.31Â h*Â ng/mL for the blood and plasma, respectively. The descending order of the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio was liver &gt; spleen &gt; kidney &gt; lung &gt; heart &gt; subcutaneous fat &gt; brain. The tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio and the tissue-to-blood concentration ratio for lung were found to be time-dependent with 267.38 and 5.55 at 120Â h postdose, respectively. A five-compartment model with first-order oral absorption and elimination best described the plasma, blood, and lung tissue pharmacokinetics. The estimated elimination rate constant (ke) for a typical monkey was 0.236Â h<sup>-1</sup>. The volume of distribution in central (Vc/F) and other two peripheral compartments (Vb/F and Vl/F) were 114, 2.68, and 5.55Â L, respectively. Model-based simulation with PK parameters from cynomolgus macaques showed that the ratio of the blood or plasma to lung tissue was a dynamic change course, which suggested that the rate of HCQ concentration decrease in the blood or plasma was faster than that in the lung tissue. HCQ was found to be accumulated in tissues, especially in the liver, kidney, lung, and spleen. Also, the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio increased over time. The population pharmacokinetic model developed could allow for the assessment of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics relationships, especially relevant tissue concentration-response for HCQ. Determining appropriate treatment regimens in animals allows translation of these to clinical studies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Liu, Bi, Chen, Guo, Tu, Tong, Xu, Liu, Wang, Jiang, Wang, Li, Wang, Liu and Song.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04340349,Registry,2/1/2021,5/30/2021,Interventional,Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine and Bromhexine: a Novel Regimen for COVID-19 Prophylaxis in Healthcare Professionals,Enrolling by invitation,Early Phase 1,Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33519466,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04340349,1,16,17,0,NA,Mexico,0,4,Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate|Bromhexine 8 MG,0,2.1109

Techniques to reduce the risk of other transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) are warranted as recent ECP survivors are ineligible as routine blood donors. As part of an ongoing clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ECP, the impact of amotosalen/UVA pathogen reduction technology (PRT) on EBOV antibody characteristics was examined.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS"">Serum and plasma samples were collected from EVD-recovered subjects at multiple timepoints and evaluated by ELISA for antibodies to recombinant EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and irradiated whole EBOV antigen, as well as for EBOV microneutralization, classic plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and EBOV pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA) activity.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Six subjects donated 40 individual ECP units.

Although RNA viruses replicate in the infected host cell cytoplasm, the nucleus is central to key stages of the infectious cycle of HIV-1 and influenza, and an important target of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) in limiting the host antiviral response. We previously identified the small molecule ivermectin as an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase nuclear entry, subsequently showing ivermectin could inhibit DENV NS5 nuclear import, as well as limit infection by viruses such as HIV-1 and DENV. We show here that ivermectin's broad spectrum antiviral activity relates to its ability to target the host importin (IMP) Î±/Î²1 nuclear transport proteins responsible for nuclear entry of cargoes such as integrase and NS5. We establish for the first time that ivermectin can dissociate the preformed IMPÎ±/Î²1 heterodimer, as well as prevent its formation, through binding to the IMPÎ± armadillo (ARM) repeat domain to impact IMPÎ± thermal stability and Î±-helicity. We show that ivermectin inhibits NS5-IMPÎ± interaction in a cell context using quantitative bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Finally, we show for the first time that ivermectin can limit infection by the DENV-related West Nile virus at low (Î¼M) concentrations. Since it is FDA approved for parasitic indications, ivermectin merits closer consideration as a broad spectrum antiviral of interest.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The absence of a specific antiviral therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stated. The authors analyzed results of early randomized studies using lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir in COVID-19 and their potential for the treatment of novel coronavirus infection. Among the drugs blocking the virus entry into cells, the greatest attention was paid to the antimalaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The article addresses in detail ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. Spironolactone may have a similar feature. Due to its antiandrogenic effects, spironolactone can inhibit X-chromosome-related synthesis of ACE-2 receptors and activation of transmembrane serin protease 2. In addition to slowing the virus entry into cells, spironolactone decreases severity of fibrosis in different organs, including the lungs. The major part of the article addresses clinical examples of managing patients with COVID-19 at the University Clinic of the Medical Research and Educational Centre of the M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, including successful treatment with schemes containing bromhexine and spironolactone. In conclusion, the authors described the design of a randomized, prospective BISCUIT study performed at the University Clinic of the M. V.

The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients.

The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyper-inflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p = 0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p = 0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119Â cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ""CellPhoneDB"" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Shenzhen Third People\\u0019s Hospital.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A Randomized Controlled Trial.,7/20/2021,Frontiers in medicine,"<AbstractText><b>Introduction:</b> Severe lung injury is triggered by both the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subsequent host-immune response in some COVID-19 patients. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a randomized, single-center, open-label, phase II trial with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) vs. SoC alone, in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome was time to clinical stability within 56 days after randomization. <b>Results:</b> From April 1 to May 2, 2020, 55 patients were prospectively included for subsequent randomization; 27 were assigned to the experimental group and 28 to the control group. The experimental treatment was not associated with a difference in time to clinical stability (hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.39-1.37]) nor most secondary outcomes. Median methylprednisolone cumulative doses were significantly lower (360 mg [IQR 360-842] vs. 870 mg [IQR 364-1451]; p = 0.007), and administered for a shorter time (median of 4.00 days [3.00-17.5] vs. 18.5 days [3.00-53.2]; p = 0.011) in the experimental group than in the control group. Although not statistically significant, those receiving the experimental therapy showed a numerically lower all-cause mortality than those receiving SoC, especially at day 10 [2 (7.41%) vs. 5 (17.9%); OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.05-2.1); <i>p</i> = 0.282]. The total number of non-serious adverse events was 42 in each the two groups. Those receiving experimental treatment had a numerically higher rate of non-serious infectious adverse events [16 (38%) vs. 10 (24%)] and serious infectious adverse events [7 (35%) vs. 3 (23%)] than those receiving SoC. <b>Conclusions:</b> The combined use of methylprednisolone pulses plus tacrolimus, in addition to the SoC, did not significantly improve the time to clinical stability or other secondary outcomes compared with the SoC alone in severe COVID-19. Although not statistically significant, patients receiving the experimental therapy had numerically lower all-cause mortality than those receiving SoC, supporting recent non-randomized studies with calcineurin inhibitors. It is noteworthy that the present trial had a limited sample size and several other limitations. Therefore, further RCTs should be done to assess the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus to tackle the inflammatory stages of COVID-19. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Identifier [NCT04341038/EudraCT: 2020-001445-39].</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Solanich, AntolÃ­, Rocamora-Blanch, PadullÃ©s, Fanlo-Maresma, Iriarte, Mitjavila, Capdevila, Riera-Mestre, Bas, Vicens-Zygmunt, NiubÃ³, Calvo, Bolivar, Rigo-Bonnin, Mensa-VilarÃ³, Arregui, Tebe, Videla, Hereu and Corbella.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04341038,Abstract,4/1/2020,6/1/2020,Interventional,Clinical Trial to Evaluate Methylprednisolone Pulses and Tacrolimus in Patients With COVID-19 Lung Injury,Recruiting,Phase 3,Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34195214,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04341038,2,0,2,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Tacrolimus|Methylprednisolone,0,2.1005

Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with peer support workers (PSWs) experience not only the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences but also feel hope in the possibility of recovery. So far, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs with PSWs that has been evaluated.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">This paper presents the protocol for a web-based intervention facilitated by PSWs. The five principal research questions are whether this intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery, (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. This will help us assess the impact of PSWs in this setting.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">PSWs will lead a typical informal peer support group within the larger context of online peer support groups, focusing on personal-civic recovery. They will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be 2 experimental subgroups-patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10) and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10)-compared to a control group (n=10). Random assignment to the intervention and control arms will be conducted using a 2:1 ratio. Several instruments will be used to assess clinical recovery (eg, the Recovery Assessment Scale, the Citizenship Measure questionnaire). The COVID-19 Stress Scales will be used to assess effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to COVID-19. Changes will be compared between groups from baseline to endpoint in the intervention and control groups using the Student paired sample t test.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">This pilot study was funded in March 2020. The protocol was approved on June 16, 2020, by the Research Ethics Committees of the Montreal Mental Health University Institute. Recruitment took place during the months of July and August, and results are expected in December 2020.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Study results will provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of a web-based intervention provided by PSWs. The investigators, alongside key decision makers and patient partners, will ensure knowledge translation throughout, and our massive open online course (MOOC), The Fundamentals of Recovery, will be updated with the evidence and new knowledge generated by this feasibility study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04445324; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04445324.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">PRR1-10.2196/22500.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Jean-Francois Pelletier, Janie Houle, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Goulet, Robert-Paul Juster, Charles-Ã‰douard GiguÃ¨re, Jonathan Bordet, Isabelle HÃ©nault, Alain Lesage, Luigi De Benedictis, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Denis, Roger Ng.

While the majority of patients were considered mild, critically ill patients involving respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are not uncommon, which could result death. We hypothesized that cytokine storm is associated with severe outcome. We enrolled 102 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Renmin Hospital (Wuhan, China). All patients were classified into moderate, severe and critical groups according to their symptoms. 45 control samples of healthy volunteers were also included. Inflammatory cytokines and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) profiles of serum samples were analyzed by specific immunoassays. Results showed that COVID-19 patients have higher serum level of cytokines (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) and CRP than control individuals. Within COVID-19 patients, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are significantly higher in critical group (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰17) than in moderate (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰42) and severe (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰43) group. The levels of IL-10 is positively correlated with CRP amount (<i>r</i>â€‰=â€‰0.41, <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Using univariate logistic regression analysis, IL-6 and IL-10 are found to be predictive of disease severity and receiver operating curve analysis could further confirm this result (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.841, 0.822 respectively). Our result indicated higher levels of cytokine storm is associated with more severe disease development. Among them, IL-6 and IL-10 can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of disease deterioration. Given the high levels of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2, treatment to reduce inflammation-related lung damage is critical.</AbstractText>",NCT04340349,Registry,2/1/2021,5/30/2021,Interventional,Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine and Bromhexine: a Novel Regimen for COVID-19 Prophylaxis in Healthcare Professionals,Enrolling by invitation,Early Phase 1,Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475230,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04340349,1,16,17,0,NA,Mexico,0,4,Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate|Bromhexine 8 MG,0,2.0969

Ivermectin is a broad spectrum antiparasitic endectocide clinically used for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control at single doses of 150 to 200 mcg/kg. It also shortens the lifespan of mosquitoes that feed on individuals recently treated with ivermectin. However, the effect after a 150 to 200 mcg/kg oral dose is short-lived (6 to 11 days). Modeling suggests higher doses, which prolong the mosquitocidal effects, are needed to make a significant contribution to malaria elimination. Ivermectin has a wide therapeutic index and previous studies have shown doses up to 2000 mcg/kg (ie, 10 times the US Food and Drug Administration approved dose) are well tolerated and safe; the highest dose used for onchocerciasis is a single dose of 800 mcg/kg.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ivermectin doses of 0, 300, and 600 mcg/kg/day for 3 days, when provided with a standard 3-day course of the antimalarial dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), on mosquito survival.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 3-arm, dose-finding trial in adults with uncomplicated malaria. Monte Carlo simulations based on pharmacokinetic modeling were performed to determine the optimum dosing regimens to be tested. Modeling showed that a 3-day regimen of 600 mcg/kg/day achieved similar median (5 to 95 percentiles) maximum drug concentrations (Cmax) of ivermectin to a single of dose of 800 mcg/kg, while increasing the median time above the lethal concentration 50% (LC50, 16 ng/mL) from 1.9 days (1.0 to 5.7) to 6.8 (3.8 to 13.4) days. The 300 mcg/kg/day dose was chosen at 50% of the higher dose to allow evaluation of the dose response. Mosquito survival will be assessed daily up to 28 days in laboratory-reared Anopheles gambiae s.s. populations fed on patients' blood taken at days 0, 2 (Cmax), 7 (primary outcome), 10, 14, 21, and 28 after the start of treatment. Safety outcomes include QT-prolongation and mydriasis. The trial will be conducted in 6 health facilities in western Kenya and requires a sample size of 141 participants (47 per arm). Sub-studies include (1) rich pharmacokinetics and (2) direct skin versus membrane feeding assays.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Recruitment started July 20, 2015.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide.

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host-virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.</AbstractText>",NCT04340349,Registry,2/1/2021,5/30/2021,Interventional,Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine and Bromhexine: a Novel Regimen for COVID-19 Prophylaxis in Healthcare Professionals,Enrolling by invitation,Early Phase 1,Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167747,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04340349,1,16,17,0,NA,Mexico,0,4,Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate|Bromhexine 8 MG,0,2.0937

There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in vitro and in vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in vitro.

The study is planned to be carried out within two separate cohorts in voluntary participants aged between 18-59 years old. The first cohort includes healthcare professionals actively working in healthcare units, who are assumed to have higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the second cohort includes other immunocompetent subjects in the same age group, who are at a regular risk for COVID-19 disease. In Cohort 1, healthcare professionals will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of investigational product or the placebo in a 1:1 ratio and they will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19.

Pregnant (confirmed by positive beta-hCG test) and breastfeeding women as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months. Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection). Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade â‰¥3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RANDOMISATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Eligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups.

After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""BLINDING (MASKING)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts. The remaining 11640 subjects will be screened in the Cohort 2 and eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL STATUS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Protocol version 6.0 - 15 October 2020.

Nebulized anticoagulants are thought to have beneficial effects as they could attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy and maybe even affect pulmonary inflammation. A systematic search of the medical literature was performed using terms referring to aspects of the condition ('pneumonia', 'inhalation trauma' and 'ARDS'), the intervention ('nebulized', 'vaporized', and 'aerosolized') and anticoagulants limited to agents that are commercially available and frequently given or tested in critically ill patients ['heparin', 'danaparoid', 'activated protein C' (APC), 'antithrombin' (AT) and 'tissue factor pathway inhibitor' (TFPI)]. The systematic search identified 16 articles reporting on preclinical studies and 11 articles reporting on human trials. All nebulized anticoagulants attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy in preclinical studies using various models for lung injury, but the effects on inflammation are less consistent. Nebulized heparin, danaparoid and TFPI, but not APC and AT also reduced systemic coagulation. Nebulized heparin in lung injury patients shows contradictory results, and there is concern over systemic side effects of this strategy. Future studies need to focus on the way to nebulize anticoagulants, as well as on efficient but safe dosages, and other side effects.</AbstractText>",NCT04466670,Registry,7/11/2020,12/30/2021,Interventional,Hemostasis in COVID-19: an Adaptive Clinical Trial,Recruiting,Phase 2,University of Sao Paulo General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29264361,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04466670,0,25,25,0,NA,Brazil,0,1,acetylsalicylic acid|Unfractionated heparin nebulized,0,2.0837

A case control, proof of concept study.",7/20/2020,Pharmacological research,"<AbstractText>Patients affected by severe coronavirus induced disease-2019 (Covid-19) often experience hypoxemia due to alveolar involvement and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the formation of micro thrombi in the pulmonary capillary vessels. Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death. To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking. This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability. We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group. Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 Î¼g/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 Î¼g/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours. Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days. Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay. All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures. Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment. PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased by 52 mmHg (50, P = 0.172), 64 mmHg (47, P = 0.040) and 112 mmHg (51, P = 0.036) after 24, 48 hours and 7 days, respectively. All patients but one were successfully weaned from CPAP after 3 days. This was not true for the control group. No major adverse events were observed. Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P&lt;0.001).

The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state. Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy. However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis. In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial. Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China.

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

While the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone have been approved for the treatment of IPF, they only slow disease progression and can induce several side-effects, suggesting that there is still an unmet need to develop new efficacious drugs, and interventions strategies, to combat this disease. We have recently developed a sheep model of pulmonary fibrosis for the preclinical testing of novel anti-fibrotic drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of pirfenidone to ascertain its suitability as a benchmark for comparing other novel therapeutics in this sheep model. To initiate localized fibrosis, sheep were given two infusions of bleomycin (0.6â€‰U/ml per infusion), a fortnight apart, to a specific lung segment. The contralateral lung segment in each sheep was infused with saline to act as an internal control. Two weeks after the final bleomycin infusion, either pirfenidone or methylcellulose (vehicle control) were administered orally to sheep twice daily for 5â€‰weeks. Results showed that sheep treated with pirfenidone had improved lung function, ameliorated fibrotic pathology, lower numbers of active myofibroblasts, and reduced extra cellular matrix deposition when compared with the relevant measurements obtained from control sheep treated with vehicle. This study showed that pirfenidone can attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in sheep, and can therefore be used as a positive control to assess other novel therapeutics for IPF in this model.</AbstractText>",NCT04282902,Registry,2/4/2020,4/30/2020,Interventional,A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone With Novel Coronavirus Infection,Recruiting,Phase 3,Tongji Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31762329,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04282902,0,4,4,0,NA,China,0,0,pirfenidone,0,2.0749

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020, Gostic et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04627467,Registry,3/28/2020,7/9/2020,Interventional,Prevention With Chloroquine in Health Personnel Exposed to Infection With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (TS-COVID),"Active, not recruiting",Phase 2,Fundacion Clinica Valle del Lili,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091395,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04627467,0,16,16,0,NA,Colombia,0,1,Chloroquine,0,2.0723

The data reviewed included those of clinical manifestations, laboratory investigation and Radiographic features. <b>Results:</b> The patients consisted of 10 men and 20 women, including 22 doctors and 8 nurses,aged 21~59 years(mean 35Â±8 years).They were divided to 26 common type and 4 severe cases, all of whom had close(within 1m) contact with patients infected of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%) , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine blood test revealed WBC &lt;4.0Ã—10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) Ã—10(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC&gt;4.0Ã—10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count &lt;1.0Ã—10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (&gt;0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. <b>Conclusion:</b> Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus.

This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800â€‰mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800â€‰mg two times per day for 4-7â€‰days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5Â±1â€‰day, 10Â±1 day, 15Â±2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population.

Here we present a comprehensive examination of the host- and virus-targeted functions of the flavonolignan silibinin, a potential drug candidate against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. As a direct inhibitor of STAT3-a master checkpoint regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune response-silibinin might be expected to phenotypically integrate the mechanisms of action of IL-6-targeted monoclonal antibodies and pan-JAK1/2 inhibitors to limit the cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia in the clinical setting of severe COVID-19. As a computationally predicted, remdesivir-like inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-the central component of the replication/transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2-silibinin is expected to reduce viral load and impede delayed interferon responses. The dual ability of silibinin to target both the host cytokine storm and the virus replication machinery provides a strong rationale for the clinical testing of silibinin against the COVID-19 global public health emergency. A randomized, open-label, phase II multicentric clinical trial (SIL-COVID19) will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of silibinin in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in moderate-to-severe COVID-19-positive onco-hematological patients at the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Catalonia, Spain.</AbstractText>",NCT04816682,Registry,3/17/2021,6/30/2021,Interventional,Silymarin in COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Hospital With Elevated Liver Enzymes,Recruiting,Phase 4,F.D.

Here, we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd-COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, T helper (Th)1-dominated cellular response. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at a massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors.

The SARS-CoV-2 represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed <i>in silico</i> analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: Â© 2021 Veljkovic V et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04382768,Registry,5/1/2020,1/31/2021,Interventional,Inhaled Ibuprofen to Treat COVID-19,Recruiting,N/A,QuÃ­mica Luar SRL,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32419926,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04382768,0,3,3,0,NA,Argentina,0,3,Inhaled Hypertonic ibuprofen,0,2.0384

Additionally, our results show significant synergy between water soluble Na-ibuprofen (IBU-Na) and ionic strength. Salt concentrations above 0.5 M modify the zeta potential promoting the action of Na-IBU; thus, with 1 M sodium chloride, IBU-Na is ten times more efficient than in the absence of ionic strength, and the minimum effective contact time is reduced from hours to minutes. In short time periods, where neither IBU-Na nor controls with 1 M NaCl show activity, the combination of both leads to a reduction in the bacterial load. We also analyzed whether the changes caused by salt on the bacterial membrane also promoted the activity of other microbicide compounds used in cystic fibrosis like gentamicin, tobramycin and phosphomycin. The results show that the presence of ionic strength only enhanced the bactericidal activity of the amphipathic molecule of IBU-Na. In this respect, the effect of saline concentration was also reflected in the surface properties of IBU-Na, where, in addition to the clear differences observed between 145 mM and 1 M, singular behaviors were also found, different in each condition. The combination of anti-inflammatory activity and this improved bactericidal effect of Na-IBU in hypertonic solution provides a new alternative for the treatment of respiratory infections of fibrotic patients based on known and widely used compounds.</AbstractText>",NCT04382768,Registry,5/1/2020,1/31/2021,Interventional,Inhaled Ibuprofen to Treat COVID-19,Recruiting,N/A,QuÃ­mica Luar SRL,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29772761,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04382768,0,3,3,0,NA,Argentina,0,3,Inhaled Hypertonic ibuprofen,0,2.032

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated the 18-month randomized controlled ACTLIFE exercise intervention immediately after the 13-month follow-up assessment. This put an abrupt stop to the high-intensity aerobic and resistance group exercise sessions undertaken three times per week by the exercise group (EG: nâ€‰=â€‰27) and the gentle exercise program performed once per week for the attention control group (CG: nâ€‰=â€‰27); but both groups were permitted to conduct individual outdoor activity for the 3-month lock-down period. Study endpoints were lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS), maximum hip-/leg extension strength and power. Detraining-induced reductions of LBM, hip/leg strength and power (but not BMD-LS) were significantly greater (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001 to pâ€‰=â€‰0.044) compared with the CG.

Although it has been suggested that ARBs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experimental data suggest that ARBs may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, despite these hypotheses, specific studies on ARBs in SARS-CoV-2 patients are lacking. METHODS: The PRAETORIAN-COVID trial is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized clinical trial in adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n = 651). The primary aim is to investigate the effect of the ARB valsartan compared to placebo on the composite end point of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death within 14 days of randomization. The active-treatment arm will receive valsartan in a dosage titrated to blood pressure up to a maximum of 160 mg bid, and the placebo arm will receive matching placebo. Treatment duration will be 14 days, or until the occurrence of the primary end point or until hospital discharge, if either of these occurs within 14 days. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04335786, 2020). SUMMARY: The PRAETORIAN-COVID trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized trial to assess the effect of valsartan compared to placebo on the occurrence of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The results of this study might impact the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients globally.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on an I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold (hereafter designated RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing-antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an Î±-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist adsorbed to alum; CpG1018-alum, a TLR9 agonist formulated in alum; and alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-alum, AS37 or alum induced substantial neutralizing-antibody and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD-NP in AS03 (RBD-NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD-NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD-NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP-AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion-stabilized spike immunogen (HexaPro) with AS03 adjuvant. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and have led to phase I/II clinical trials of this vaccine (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).</AbstractText>",NCT04750343,Abstract,2/3/2021,7/31/2021,Interventional,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of SARS-CoV-2 Nanoparticle Vaccine (GBP510) Adjuvanted With or Without AS03 (COVID-19),"Active, not recruiting",Phase 1/Phase 2,"SK Chemicals Co., Ltd.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33873199,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04750343,1,0,1,0,NA,"Korea, Republic of",0,1,GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (RBD 10Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|GBP510 (RBD 10Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) - Stage 1|GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (RBD 25Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|GBP510 (RBD 25Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) - Stage 1|GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (RBD 10Î¼g/dose) - Stage 2|GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (RBD 25Î¼g/dose)- Stage 2|GBP510 (RBD 25Î¼g/dose)- Stage 2|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution)- Stage 2,1,2.0168

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1Â·10, 95% CI 1Â·03-1Â·17, per year increase; p=0Â·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5Â·65, 2Â·61-12Â·23; p&lt;0Â·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 Î¼g/mL (18Â·42, 2Â·64-128Â·55; p=0Â·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20Â·0 days (IQR 17Â·0-24Â·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 Î¼g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.

The context of COVID-19 epidemic and the related confinement could increase the rate of negative experience and mental disorders. The main objective is to compare, in immediate post partum, the maternal sense of control during childbirth between a group of women who gave birth during confinement ('confinement' group) versus a group of women who gave birth after confinement but in the context of epidemic ('epidemic' group) versus a group of control women ('control' group; excluding confinement and epidemic context).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">This is a national multicentre prospective cohort study conducted in four French maternity units. We expect to include 927 women in a period of 16 months. Women will be recruited immediately in post partum during three different periods constituting the three groups: 'confinement'; 'epidemic' and 'control' group. The maternal sense of control will be evaluated by the Labour Agentry Scale questionnaire completed immediately in post partum.

Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6-10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Findings"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86).

After inhalation, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 penetrate to the depths of the lungs and cause severe pneumonia, alveolar injury, and life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines available to cure or prevent COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related ARDS, a new therapeutic agent which will support oxygen supply and, at the same time, efficiently alleviate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation is urgently needed. Due to their potent immuno- and angiomodulatory characteristics, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may increase oxygen supply in the lungs and may efficiently alleviate ongoing lung inflammation, including SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. In this review article, we described molecular mechanisms that are responsible for MSC-based modulation of immune cells which play a pathogenic role in the development of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS and we provided a brief outline of already conducted and ongoing clinical studies that increase our understanding about the therapeutic potential of MSCs and their secretome in the therapy of COVID-19-related ARDS.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Carl Randall Harrell et al.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04753476,Registry,6/8/2020,2/1/2022,Interventional,Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Patients Using Secretome of Hypoxia-Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Indonesia,Recruiting,Phase 2,Stem Cell and Cancer Research Indonesia,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274176,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04753476,0,2,2,0,NA,Indonesia,0,2,Injection of Secretome-MSCs|Standard treatment of Covid-19,0,2.0061

The event took place in the Sala Apolo, Barcelona, Spain. Adults aged 18-59 years with a negative result in an Ag-RDT from a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately before entering the event were randomised 1:1 (block randomisation stratified by age and gender) to either attend the indoor event for 5 hours or go home. Nasopharyngeal specimens used for Ag-RDT screening were analysed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cell culture (Vero E6 cells). 8 days after the event, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and analysed by Ag-RDT, RT-PCR, and a transcription-mediated amplification test (TMA). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 days between the control and the intervention groups, assessed in all participants who were randomly assigned, attended the event, and had a valid result for the SARS-CoV-2 test done at follow-up.

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1Â·9 [SD 0Â·9] years; range 5 months to 4Â·4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4Â·3%; 95% CI 2Â·6-7Â·1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7Â·7%; 4Â·2-11Â·6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3Â·7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1Â·3-6Â·8) of the children and 6Â·8% (3Â·2-11Â·5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5Â·5%; 95% CI 2Â·9-10Â·1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5Â·0% (95% CrI 1Â·6-9Â·8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7Â·1 [95% CI 2Â·2-22Â·4]).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this exploratory hypothesis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Assistance Publique-HÃ´pitaux de Paris; Mairie de Paris, Conseil DÃ©partemental de Seine Saint Denis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRANSLATIONS"">For the French translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In the rush to possible therapeutic options, probiotics administration has been proposed mainly based on indirect observation. Some evidence of COVID-19 effects on intestinal microbiota dysbiosis has been shown and probiotics have been considered for their efficacy in the management of respiratory tract viral infections. These observations could be reinforced by the more and more evident existence of a lung-gut axis, suggesting the modulation of gut microbiota among the approaches to the COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As different possible roles of probiotics in this extremely severe illness have been contemplated, the aim of this work is to collect all the currently available information related to this topic, providing a starting point for future studies focussing on it.</AbstractText>",NCT04517422,Registry,8/19/2020,2/2/2021,Interventional,Efficacy of L.

However, the immunological role of iron in viral infections has not been well defined. Here we found the iron salt ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) inhibited Influenza A virus, HIV virus, Zika virus, and Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections. Of note, both iron ion and citrate ion were required for the antiviral capability of FAC, as other iron salts and citrates did not exhibit viral inhibition. Mechanistically, FAC inhibited viral infection through inducing viral fusion and blocking endosomal viral release. These were further evidenced by the fact that FAC induced liposome aggregation and intracellular vesicle fusion, which was associated with a unique iron-dependent cell death. Our results demonstrate a novel antiviral function of FAC and suggest a therapeutic potential for iron in the control of viral infections.</AbstractText>",NCT04333550,Registry,4/30/2020,9/30/2020,Interventional,Application of Desferal to Treat COVID-19,Recruiting,Phase 1/Phase 2,Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29619244,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333550,0,16,16,0,NA,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",0,2,Deferoxamine,0,2.0018

Likewise, SARS-CoV2 infection can be fatal as the disease advances to pneumonia, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The development of lethal clinical symptons is associated with an exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines, referred to as the cytokine storm, is a consequence of a hyperactivated immune response aginst the infection. In this article, we discuss the pathogenic consequences of the cytokine storm and its relationship with COVID-19 associated risk factors. The increased pro-inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, COPD) exacerbates the Cytokine-storm of COVID-19 into a 'Cytokine Super Cyclone'. We also evaluate the antiviral immune responses provided by BCG vaccination and the potential role of 'trained immunity' in early protection against SARS-CoV2.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The most severe form of the disease presents with fever and shortness of breath, which rapidly deteriorates to respiratory failure and acute lung injury (ALI). COVID-19 also presents with a severe coagulopathy with a high rate of venous thromboembiolism. In addition, autopsy studies have revealed co-localized thrombosis and inflammation, which is the signature of thromboinflammation, within the pulmonary capillary vasculature. While the majority of published data is on adult patients, there are parallels to pediatric patients. In our experience as a COVID-19 epicenter, children and young adults do develop both the coagulopathy and the ALI of COVID-19. This review will discuss COVID-19 ALI from a hematological perspective with discussion of the distinct aspects of coagulation that are apparent in COVID-19. Current and potential interventions targeting the multiple thromboinflammatory mechanisms will be discussed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A workflow was set up to study serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate antibody neutralisation capacity in patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests will be assessed using molecular detection of the virus as a reference. The measurement of IgM and IgG antibodies will be performed once per week for 6 consecutive weeks and then at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after the diagnosis.

Lung-protective ventilation is the current standard of care in patients with ARDS, but it might lead to hypercapnia, which is independently associated with worse outcomes. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO<sub>2</sub>R) has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy to avoid progression of clinical severity and limit further ventilator-induced lung injury, but its use in COVID-19 has not been described yet. Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients. In centers with available dialysis, low-flow ECCO<sub>2</sub>R (&lt;500 mL/min) using RRT platforms could be carried out by dialysis specialists and might be an option to efficiently allocate resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with hypercapnia as the main indication. Here, we report the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of ECCO<sub>2</sub>R using an RRT platform to provide either standalone ECCO<sub>2</sub>R or ECCO<sub>2</sub>R combined with RRT in four hypercapnic patients with moderate ARDS.

Essential oils are complex volatile compounds, synthesized naturally in different plant parts during the process of secondary metabolism. Essential oils have great potential in the field of biomedicine as they effectively destroy several bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. The presence of different types of aldehydes, phenolics, terpenes, and other antimicrobial compounds means that the essential oils are effective against a diverse range of pathogens. The reactivity of essential oil depends upon the nature, composition, and orientation of its functional groups. The aim of this article is to review the antimicrobial potential of essential oils secreted from MAPs and their possible mechanisms of action against human pathogens. This comprehensive review will benefit researchers who wish to explore the potential of essential oils in the development of novel broad-spectrum key molecules against a broad range of drug-resistant pathogenic microbes.</AbstractText>",NCT04627519,Registry,12/9/2020,5/19/2021,Interventional,Effectiveness and Safety of Rhea Health ToneÂ® as add-on Therapy for COVID-19 in Hospitalized Adults in Indonesia,"Active, not recruiting",N/A,Universitas Padjadjaran,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28090211,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04627519,0,13,13,0,NA,Indonesia,0,4,Rhea Health ToneÂ®,0,1.992

Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment. We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation. A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide. This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide. The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events. Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell and humoral responses. CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide.

WeÂ are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such asÂ changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasalÂ microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review,Â it may not be large.Â InÂ these circumstances in particularÂ it may be a challengeÂ to weighÂ up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

32595361,Journal Article, , ,Gut-lung axis and dysbiosis in COVID-19.,9/28/2020,Turkish journal of biology = Turk biyoloji dergisi,"<AbstractText>COVID-19, a novel infectious disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, affected millions of people around the world with a high mortality rate. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system. This review points out the role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota involving in sepsis, on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, this review aims to clarify the ambiguity in fecal-oral transmission of SARS- CoV-2.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04517422,Registry,8/19/2020,2/2/2021,Interventional,Efficacy of L.

32670091,Journal Article|Review, , ,The Modulation of Mucosal Antiviral Immunity by Immunobiotics: Could They Offer Any Benefit in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic?,9/28/2020,Frontiers in physiology,"<AbstractText>Viral respiratory infections are of major importance because of their capacity to cause of a high degree of morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations, and to rapidly spread between countries. Perhaps the best example of this global threat is the infectious disease caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has infected more than 4 million people worldwide, causing the death of 287,000 persons according to the WHO's situation report on May 13, 2020. The availability of therapeutic tools that would be used massively to prevent or mitigate the detrimental effects of emerging respiratory viruses on human health is therefore mandatory. In this regard, research from the last decade has reported the impact of the intestinal microbiota on the respiratory immunity. It was conclusively demonstrated how the variations in the intestinal microbiota affect the responses of respiratory epithelial cells and antigen presenting cells against respiratory virus attack. Moreover, the selection of specific microbial strains (immunobiotics) with the ability to modulate immunity in distal mucosal sites made possible the generation of nutritional interventions to strengthen respiratory antiviral defenses. In this article, the most important characteristics of the limited information available regarding the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 virus are revised briefly. In addition, this review summarizes the knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the improvement of respiratory antiviral defenses by beneficial immunobiotic microorganisms such as <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> CRL1505. The ability of beneficial microorganisms to enhance type I interferons and antiviral factors in the respiratory tract, stimulate Th1 response and antibodies production, and regulate inflammation and coagulation activation during the course of viral infections reducing tissue damage and preserving lung functionally, clearly indicate the potential of immunobiotics to favorably influence the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 virus.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Villena and Kitazawa.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04517422,Registry,8/19/2020,2/2/2021,Interventional,Efficacy of L.

Since there are currently no coded therapies or guidelines for treatment of COVID-19, this study aimed to evaluate the possible role of a specific oral bacteriotherapy as complementary therapeutic strategy to avoid the progression of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We provide a report of 70 patients positive for COVID-19, hospitalized between March 9th and April 4th, 2020. All the patients had fever, required non-invasive oxygen therapy and presented a CT lung involvement on imaging more than 50%. Forty-two patients received hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, and tocilizumab, alone or in combination. A second group of 28 subjects received the same therapy added with oral bacteriotherapy, using a multistrain formulation. <b>Results:</b> The two cohorts of patients were comparable for age, sex, laboratory values, concomitant pathologies, and the modality of oxygen support. Within 72 h, nearly all patients treated with bacteriotherapy showed remission of diarrhea and other symptoms as compared to less than half of the not supplemented group. The estimated risk of developing respiratory failure was eight-fold lower in patients receiving oral bacteriotherapy. Both the prevalence of patients transferred to ICU and mortality were higher among the patients not treated with oral bacteriotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> A specific bacterial formulation showed a significant ameliorating impact on the clinical conditions of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results also stress the importance of the gut-lung axis in controlling the COVID-19 disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 d'Ettorre, Ceccarelli, Marazzato, Campagna, Pinacchio, Alessandri, Ruberto, Rossi, Celani, Scagnolari, Mastropietro, Trinchieri, Recchia, Mauro, Antonelli, Pugliese and Mastroianni.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04517422,Registry,8/19/2020,2/2/2021,Interventional,Efficacy of L.

Primary outcomes were resilience, anxiety, depression, stress or stress perception and well-being or quality of life. Secondary outcomes were resilience factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risks of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (at post-test only).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included 44 RCTs (high-income countries: 36). Thirty-nine studies solely focused on healthcare professionals (6892 participants), including both healthcare staff delivering direct medical care and allied healthcare staff. Four studies investigated mixed samples (1000 participants) with healthcare professionals and participants working outside of the healthcare sector, and one study evaluated training for emergency personnel in general population volunteers (82 participants). The included studies were mainly conducted in a hospital setting and included physicians, nurses and different hospital personnel (37/44 studies). Participants mainly included women (68%) from young to middle adulthood (mean age range: 27 to 52.4 years). Most studies investigated group interventions (30 studies) of high training intensity (18 studies; &gt; 12 hours/sessions), that were delivered face-to-face (29 studies). Of the included studies, 19 compared a resilience training based on combined theoretical foundation (e.g. mindfulness and cognitive-behavioural therapy) versus unspecific comparators (e.g. wait-list). The studies were funded by different sources (e.g. hospitals, universities), or a combination of different sources. Fifteen studies did not specify the source of their funding, and one study received no funding support. Risk of bias was high or unclear for most studies in performance, detection, and attrition bias domains. At post-intervention, very-low certainty evidence indicated that, compared to controls, healthcare professionals receiving resilience training may report higher levels of resilience (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.65; 12 studies, 690 participants), lower levels of depression (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.09; 14 studies, 788 participants), and lower levels of stress or stress perception (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.15; 17 studies, 997 participants). There was little or no evidence of any effect of resilience training on anxiety (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23; 5 studies, 231 participants; very-low certainty evidence) or well-being or quality of life (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.30; 13 studies, 1494 participants; very-low certainty evidence). Effect sizes were small except for resilience and stress reduction (moderate). Data on adverse effects were available for three studies, with none reporting any adverse effects occurring during the study (very-low certainty evidence).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">For healthcare professionals, there is very-low certainty evidence that, compared to control, resilience training may result in higher levels of resilience, lower levels of depression, stress or stress perception, and higher levels of certain resilience factors at post-intervention. The paucity of medium- or long-term data, heterogeneous interventions and restricted geographical distribution limit the generalisability of our results. Conclusions should therefore be drawn cautiously. The findings suggest positive effects of resilience training for healthcare professionals, but the evidence is very uncertain. There is a clear need for high-quality replications and improved study designs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.</AbstractText>",NCT04424953,Registry,6/1/2020,9/25/2020,Interventional,To Compare Videolaryngoscope Against Direct Laryngoscope for Intubation When Powered Air Purifying Respirator is Worn,Completed,N/A,Singapore General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102726,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04424953,0,14,14,0,NA,Singapore,0,3,McGrath videolaryngoscope|Direct laryngoscope,0,1.9878

The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.</AbstractText>",NCT04424953,Registry,6/1/2020,9/25/2020,Interventional,To Compare Videolaryngoscope Against Direct Laryngoscope for Intubation When Powered Air Purifying Respirator is Worn,Completed,N/A,Singapore General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32052373,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04424953,0,14,14,0,NA,Singapore,0,3,McGrath videolaryngoscope|Direct laryngoscope,0,1.9827

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2Â·68 (95% CrI 2Â·47-2Â·86) and that 75â€ˆ815 individuals (95% CrI 37â€ˆ304-130â€ˆ330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6Â·4 days (95% CrI 5Â·8-7Â·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Health and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology.

Our hypothesis is that use of subcutaneous sarilumab in early stages (window of opportunity) of COVID-19 moderate-severe pneumonia can prevent higher oxygenation requirements through non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation and decrease in-hospital stays, as well as death rate. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of sarilumab through hospitalisation and up to day 14 after discharge, compared to the control arm as assessed by incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (SAEs). In addition, as an exploratory objective, to compare the baseline clinical and biological parameters, including serum IL-6 levels, of the intervention population against controls of the same pandemic outbreak (using a propensity score) to search for markers that identify the best candidates for the treatment with subcutaneous IL-6R inhibitors and to attempt an approximation in the temporal frame of the ""window of opportunity"" TRIAL DESIGN: SARCOVID is an investigator-initiated single center randomised proof of concept study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""PARTICIPANTS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Patients treated at the Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain requiring hospitalisation will be consecutively recruited, meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria a.

A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROBÂ 2)Â for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3Â and 7,Â Â whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RRÂ 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data fromÂ one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. ThisÂ study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were &gt; 50 ng/mL.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome.  If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths. Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities. To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission. In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals. At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death. One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. In addition, germicidal UV radiation ""breaks down"" the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19. We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04366089,Registry,3/26/2020,10/30/2020,Interventional,Oxygen-Ozone as Adjuvant Treatment in Early Control of COVID-19 Progression and Modulation of the Gut Microbial Flora,Recruiting,Phase 2,Azienda Policlinico Umberto I,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32228825,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04366089,0,3,3,0,NA,Italy,0,0,"Oxygen-ozone therapy, probiotic supplementation and Standard of care|SivoMixx (200 billion)|Azithromycin|hydroxychloroquine",0,1.6071

Participants will be individuals aged &gt;â€‰6â€‰months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7â€‰days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14â€‰days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.

Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de AnestesiologÃ­a, ReanimaciÃ³n y TerapÃ©utica del Dolor.

It is believed to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus cell fusion and glycosylation of viral surface proteins. In addition to its antiviral activity, hydroxychloroquine has an immune-modulating activity that may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo, making it a potentially promising drug for the prevention and the cure of SARS-CoV-19. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether it can be used safely to treat COVID-19 patients or to prevent infection. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for (I) the prevention of COVID-19 or related symptoms in SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, such as as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients and (II) the treatment of early-phase asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This is a controlled, open label, cluster-randomized, superiority trial with parallel group design. Subjects will be randomized either to receive hydroxychloroquine or to observation (2:1).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""PARTICIPANTS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, including household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals (Group 1) or patients with COVID-19 (positive PCR test on a rhinopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situations who are not undergoing treatment with any anti COVID-19 medication (Group 2), will be enrolled. Paucisymptomatic patients are defined as patients with a low number of mild symptoms. All subjects must be aged â‰¥18 years, male or female, must be willing and able to give informed consent and must not have any contraindications to take hydroxychloroquine (intolerance or previous toxicity for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, bradycardia or reduction in heart rhythm with arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, congestive heart failure with use of diuretics, favism or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, diabetes type 1, major comorbidities such as advanced chronic kidney disease or dialysis therapy, known history of ventricular arrhythmia, any oncologic/hematologic malignancy, severe neurological and mental illness, current use of medications with known significant drug-drug interactions, and known prolonged QT syndrome or current use of drugs with known QT prolongation). The study is monocentric and will be conducted at Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS. Subjects will be enrolled from a large epidemic region (North-Central Italy). The Public Health Departments of several Italian regions will collaborate by identifying potentially eligible subjects.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The participants will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to receive either hydroxychloroquine (Arm A) or to Observation (Arm B). Hydroxychloroquine will be administered with the following schedule: Group1: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by a weekly dose of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily on days 8, 15 and 22, for a total of one month of treatment. Group 2: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for a total of 5-7 days. The comparator in this trial is observation given that currently neither treatment is administered to asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects, nor prophylaxis is available for contacts. Hydroxychloroquine will be shipped to subjects within 24 hours of randomization. Given the extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, only telephonic interviews will be carried out and electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) completed. During treatment, each subject will be contacted every other day for the first week and weekly thereafter (Group 2) or weekly (Group 1) by a study physician to assess early onset of any COVID-19 symptom or any adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine and to check subject compliance. Furthermore, all subjects will receive periodic ePROs which may be completed through smartphone or tablets to record drug self-administration and onset of any symptom or adverse event. All subjects will be followed up for a total of 6 months by periodic telephonic interviews and ePROs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The primary endpoint/outcome measure for this trial is: for Group 1, the proportion of subjects who become symptomatic and/or swab-positive in each arm within one month of randomization; for Group 2, the proportion of subjects who become swab-negative in each arm within 14 days of randomization.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RANDOMIZATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">All household members and/or contacts of each COVID-19 index case, and the COVID-19 patient himself/herself, fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be grouped into a single cluster and this cluster will be randomized (2:1) to either arm A or arm B. Information on each subject will be recorded in specific data records. Randomization lists will be stratified according to the following factors regarding COVID-19 index cases: 1. COVID-19 risk level on the basis of province of residence (high vs. low/intermediate); 2. Index case is a healthcare professional (yes vs.no) 3. Index case with COVID-19 treatment (yes vs. no) An independent statistician not otherwise involved in the trial will generate the allocation sequence, and COVID-19 response teams will be unaware of the allocation of clusters. Randomization will be performed through an interactive web-based electronic data-capturing database. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee has been established.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""BLINDING (MASKING)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">This study is open label.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">For Group 1, a sample size of about 2000 SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects such as household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients will take part in the study. Assuming around 1.5-2.0 asymptomatic household members and/or contacts for each COVID-19 patient, we expect to identify approximately 1000-1300 COVID-19 index cases to be randomized. An interim analysis on efficacy is planned using standard alpha-spending function. For Group 2, sufficient power for primary objective (negative swab within 14 days of randomization) will be reached given a sample size of 300 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 subjects in home situations not treated for COVID-19 (25%-30% of about 1000-1300 expected index cases). Since up to date reduced evidence about COVID-19 infection epidemiology, the continuous update of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the sample size estimation could be updated after a one third of population will be recruited and eventually modified according to a substantial protocol amendment. An interim analysis at 100 enrolled COVID-19 patients is planned. We have planned a Generalized Estimating Equation analysis, which is more efficient than a cluster level analysis, to take advantage of subject-specific covariates. The above reported sample size analysis is therefore to be considered conservative.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL STATUS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The current version of the PROTECT trial protocol is 'Final version, 15 April 2020'.

Yi xue ban = Journal of Zhejiang University. Medical sciences,"<AbstractText>The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.</AbstractText>",NCT04366089,Registry,3/26/2020,10/30/2020,Interventional,Oxygen-Ozone as Adjuvant Treatment in Early Control of COVID-19 Progression and Modulation of the Gut Microbial Flora,Recruiting,Phase 2,Azienda Policlinico Umberto I,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32096367,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04366089,0,3,3,0,NA,Italy,0,0,"Oxygen-ozone therapy, probiotic supplementation and Standard of care|SivoMixx (200 billion)|Azithromycin|hydroxychloroquine",0,1.5987

Coronavirus postexposure prophylaxis (COPEP) trial aims at assessing their efficacy as postexposure ring-prophylaxis among adults exposed to SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">COPEP is a two-arm open-label cluster-randomised trial conducted in three cantons of Switzerland. Asymptomatic contacts (â‰¥16 years) of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 will be randomised (2:1) to either LPV/r (400â€‰mg/100â€‰mg two times per day) for 5 days, or a standard of care arm (no treatment). Asymptomatic individuals may be either SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative. Contacts living in the single household will form a cluster and will be randomised into the same arm. All participants will be followed-up for 21 days and undergo daily monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms. The primary endpoint is 21-day incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with â‰¥1 compatible symptom, analysed in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The secondary endpoints include the 21-day incidence of COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection in a modified ITT analysis, excluding participants who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from oropharyngeal swab and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology at baseline. Assuming a 21-day incidence for COVID-19 of 20% among contacts without postexposure chemoprophylaxis, to detect a relative risk reduction of 60% (ie, translating in an absolute reduction from 20% to 8%), with a power of 80%, an alpha of 5%. Accounting for design effect of cluster design of circa 1.1, we plan to enrol 200 participants to the LPV/r arm and 100 to the standard of care arm, 300 participants in total.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">Ethics approval has been granted by the Commission Cantonale d'Ethique de la Recherche, Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz and Comitato Etico Cantonale (ref 2020-00864) and Swissmedic (2020DR3056).

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.</AbstractText>",NCT04384380,Registry,4/1/2020,5/31/2020,Interventional,Efficacy and Tolerability of Hydroxychloroquine in Adult Patients With COVID-19,Completed,N/A,Taoyuan General Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32065057,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04384380,0,5,5,0,NA,Taiwan,0,1,Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate 200 MG [Plaquenil],0,1.5924

We included 19Â studies (2Â RCTs, 8Â controlled NRSIs, 9Â non-controlled NRSIs) with 38,160Â participants, of whom 36,081Â received convalescent plasma. Two completed RCTs are awaiting assessment (published after 19 August 2020). We identified a further 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73Â are randomised (3 reported in a study registry as alreadyÂ being completed, but without results). We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We did not include data from controlled NRSIs in data synthesis because of critical risk of bias.Â The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, due toÂ study limitations and results including both potential benefits and harms.Â  Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19Â  We included results from twoÂ RCTs (both stopped early) with 189Â participants, of whom 95 received convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreasesÂ all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence).Â  We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreasesÂ mortality (time to event)Â (hazard ratio (HR)Â 0.64, 95% CI 0.33Â toÂ 1.25; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may result in little to no difference in improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. need for respiratory support) at seven days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence).Â Convalescent plasma may increase improvement of clinical symptoms at up to 15Â days (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85 toÂ 2.11;Â 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence), and at up to 30Â days (RRÂ 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 toÂ 1.43; 2Â studies, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence).Â  No studies reported on quality of life.Â  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from twoÂ RCTs, eightÂ controlled NRSIs and nineÂ non-controlled NRSIsÂ assessing safety ofÂ convalescent plasma.Â Reporting of safety data and duration of follow-upÂ was variable.Â The controlled studies reported on AEsÂ and SAEs only inÂ participants receiving convalescent plasma. Some, but not all, studies included death as a SAE.Â  The studies did not report the grade of AEs. Fourteen studies (566 participants)Â reported on AEs of possibleÂ grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these AEsÂ were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe AEs (very low-certainty evidence).Â  17 studies (35,944 participants) assessedÂ SAEsÂ forÂ 20,622Â of its participants. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (20,000 participants), which reportedÂ on SAEs withinÂ the first four hours and within an additional seven days afterÂ transfusion. There were 63 deaths, 12 were possibly and one was probably related to transfusion. There were 146 SAEsÂ within four hoursÂ and 1136 SAEs within seven days post-transfusion. These were predominantly allergic or respiratory,Â thrombotic or thromboembolic andÂ cardiac events. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy results in a clinically relevant increased risk of SAEs (low-certainty evidence).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19.Â There was limited information regardingÂ grade 3 and 4 AEs to determine the effect of convalescent plasma therapy on clinically relevant SAEs.

The early termination of the firstÂ two RCTs investigating convalescent plasma, and the lack of data from 20 studies that have completed or were due to complete at the time of this update illustrate these challenges.

We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due toÂ study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19Â  We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness ofÂ convalescent plasma.Â Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96;Â very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory supportÂ (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195Â participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasmaÂ has any effect onÂ improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19),Â 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome.Â  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non-controlled NRSIsÂ assessing safety ofÂ convalescent plasma.Â Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable.Â The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only inÂ participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow-up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event.Â  Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13Â studies, 201Â participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201Â participants)Â reported on adverse events of possibleÂ grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events.

The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited toÂ the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04453384 , registered on 1 July 2020, and EUDRACT 2020-002574-27, registered 6 June 2020.</AbstractText>",NCT04453384,Abstract,9/1/2020,12/31/2021,Interventional,Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of XAV-19 in Patients With COVID-19 Induced Moderate Pneumonia,"Active, not recruiting",Phase 2,Nantes University Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33750432,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453384,2,0,2,0,NA,France|Martinique|RÃ©union,0,3,XAV-19|Placebo,0,1.5422

Recent clinical evidence suggest that electrical and chemical stimulation of the inflammatory reflex may reduce the burden of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases. Pyridostigmine (PDG), an ACh-esterase inhibitor (i-ACh-e), increases the half-life of endogenous ACh, therefore mimicking the inflammatory reflex.

Here, we compared the immune profile of severe COVID-19 with non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ICU patients using longitudinal, high-dimensional single-cell spectral cytometry and algorithm-guided analysis. COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia both showed increased emergency myelopoiesis and displayed features of adaptive immune paralysis. However, pathological immune signatures suggestive of TÂ cell exhaustion were exclusive to COVID-19. The integration of single-cell profiling with a predicted binding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides to the patients' HLA profile further linked the COVID-19 immunopathology to impaired virus recognition.

More adverse events were reported in participants who received intramuscular vaccination, including participants in the MIX group (49 [63%] of 78 participants), than those who received aerosol vaccine (13 [25%] of 52 participants) after the first vaccine vaccination. No serious adverse events were noted within 56 days after the first vaccine. At days 28 after last vaccination, geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody was 107 (95% CI 47-245) in the HDmu group, 105 (47-232) in the LDmu group, 396 (207-758) in the MIX group, 95 (61-147) in the 1Dim group, and 180 (113-288) in the 2Dim group. The geometric mean concentrations of receptor binding domain-binding IgG was 261 EU/mL (95% CI 121-563) in the HDmu group, 289 EU/mL (138-606) in the LDmu group, 2013 EU/mL (1180-3435) in the MIX group, 915 EU/mL (588-1423) in the 1Dim group, and 1190 EU/mL (776-1824) in the 2Dim group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Aerosolised Ad5-nCoV is well tolerated, and two doses of aerosolised Ad5-nCoV elicited neutralising antibody responses, similar to one dose of intramuscular injection.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers an immune response with local inflammation in the lung, which may extend to a systemic hyperinflammatory reaction. Excessive inflammation has been reported in severe cases with respiratory failure and cardiovascular complications. In addition to the release of cytokines, referred to as cytokine release syndrome or ""cytokine storm,"" increased pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid may cause an ""eicosanoid storm,"" which contributes to the uncontrolled systemic inflammation. Specialized pro-resolving mediators, which are derived from omega-3 PUFA, limit inflammatory reactions by an active process called resolution of inflammation.

Injury to the lung is mediated by excessive mechanical stress and strain, whereas the diaphragm develops atrophy as a consequence of low respiratory effort and injury in case of excessive effort. The lung and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation approach aims to protect both organs simultaneously whenever possible. This review summarizes practical strategies for achieving lung and diaphragm-protective targets at the bedside, focusing on inspiratory and expiratory ventilator settings, monitoring of inspiratory effort or respiratory drive, management of dyssynchrony, and sedation considerations. A number of potential future adjunctive strategies including extracorporeal CO<sub>2</sub> removal, partial neuromuscular blockade, and neuromuscular stimulation are also discussed. While clinical trials to confirm the benefit of these approaches are awaited, clinicians should become familiar with assessing and managing patients' respiratory effort, based on existing physiological principles. To protect the lung and the diaphragm, ventilation and sedation might be applied to avoid excessively weak or very strong respiratory efforts and patient-ventilator dysynchrony.</AbstractText>",NCT04885517,Registry,2/1/2021,8/1/2021,Interventional,"Breathing Effort in Covid-19 Pneumonia: Effects of Positive Pressure, Inspired Oxygen Fraction and Decubitus",Recruiting,N/A,San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33140181,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04885517,0,6,6,0,NA,Italy,0,1,Esophageal catheter,0,1.5051

There is a growing need to discuss the elements of a coordinated strategy to control the spread and mitigate the severity of COVID-19. H1N1 and <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> vaccines are available. The current analysis was performed to analyze the severity of COVID-19 and influenza (H1N1) vaccination in adults â‰¥ 65. Also, to correlate the lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs), and influenza attributable to the lower respiratory tract infections' incidence with Covid-19 mortality. Evolutionarily influenza is close in resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares some common epitopes and mechanisms. <b>Methods:</b> Recent influenza vaccination data of 34 countries from OECD and other publications were correlated with COVID-19 mortality from worldometer data. LRIs attributable to influenza and streptococcus pneumonia were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, influenza-attributable LRI incidence data of various countries (<i>n</i> = 182) was correlated with COVID-19 death by linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyzes. In a logistic regression model, population density and influenza LRI incidence were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. <b>Results:</b> There is a correlation between COVID-19-related mortality, morbidity, and case incidence and the status of influenza vaccination, which appears protective. The tendency of correlation is increasingly highlighted as the pandemic is evolving. In countries where influenza immunization is less common, there is a correlation between LRIs and influenza attributable to LRI incidence and COVID-19 severity, which is beneficial. ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.86 (CI 0.78 to 0.944, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) to predict COVID-19 mortality &gt;150/million and a decreasing trend of influenza LRI episodes. To predict COVID-19 mortality of &gt;200/million population, the odds ratio for influenza incidence/100,000 was -1.86 (CI -2.75 to -0.96, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). To predict the parameter Covid-19 mortality/influenza LRI episodes<sup>*</sup>1000&gt;1000, the influenza parameter had an odd's ratio of -3.83 (CI -5.98 to -1.67), and an AUC of 0.94. <b>Conclusion:</b> Influenza (H1N1) vaccination can be used as an interim measure to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 in the general population. In appropriate high-risk circumstances, <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> vaccination would also be an adjunct strategy, especially in countries with a lower incidence of LRIs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Arokiaraj.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04798677,Registry,10/29/2020,7/31/2021,Interventional,Efficacy and Tolerability of ABBC1 in Volunteers Receiving the Influenza or Covid-19 Vaccine,Recruiting,N/A,AB Biotek,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33072682,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04798677,0,17,17,0,NA,Spain,0,2,ABBC1 Immunoessential|Placebo,1,1.5047

Healthy adults (aged â‰¥18 to â‰¤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 Î¼g, 15 Î¼g, or 45 Î¼g, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 Î¼g followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32Â·5 years [SD 10Â·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 Î¼g dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11â€ˆ122), with 15 Î¼g dose (7492, 4959-11â€ˆ319), and the two 45 Î¼g dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13â€ˆ920 in the two-dose 45 Î¼g cohort; 8793, 5570-13â€ˆ881 in the single-dose 45 Î¼g cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 Î¼g doses (102â€ˆ400, 64â€ˆ857-161â€ˆ676), with two 15 Î¼g doses (74â€ˆ725, 51â€ˆ300-108â€ˆ847), with two 45 Î¼g doses (79â€ˆ586, 55â€ˆ430-114â€ˆ268), only a single 45 Î¼g dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 Î¼g dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 Î¼g doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 Î¼g doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 Î¼g doses (239, 187-307).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, National Health and Medical Research Council, Queensland Government, and further philanthropic sources listed in the acknowledgments.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

During SSC, patients should follow the steps as instructed by their healthcare provider to care for themselves and protect other people in the home and community from potentially contracting COVID-19. Management of COVID-19-related symptoms with over-the-counter cough, cold, and anti-pyretic medications by patients is permitted in accordance with the medications' respective drug facts label or as instructed by the patient's healthcare provider. Following randomization, patients assigned to receive KB109 and SSC will receive a Kaleido Biosciences, Inc at-home study kit including a thermometer, pulse oximeter, and KB109. During the Intake Period (days 1-14), KB109 will be reconstituted in water by the patient and consumed by the patient twice daily (at least 8 hours apart), following an up-titration dosing schedule: Days 1 to 2: 9 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 18 g Days 3 to 4: 18 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 36 g Days 5 to 14: 36 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 72 g During the intake period, patients will record their daily COVID-19-related symptoms, selected COVID-19 signs (as self-measured using the provided thermometer and pulse oximeter), responses to questions related to QOL measures, health care use measures, and concomitant medications taken in the previous 24 hours. Wellness visits by telephone will be conducted between days 1 and 14 to follow up on patient's health status and to ascertain compliance with KB109 and completion of questions. On day 14, all patients will undergo a telemedicine visit where the following will be conducted: abbreviated physical examination, assessment of safety and other protocol-specified measures of health, and an evaluation of whether follow-up treatment is recommended owing to a progression of COVID-19 symptoms. If feasible, blood samples for clinical chemistries, biomarkers and serological measure of immunity, and nasal/oropharyngeal swabs for quantitative viral load assessments will be collected. Beginning on day 15, patients in both groups will enter the follow-up period (days 15-35) where COVID-19 signs, symptoms, and health care use indices will be collected. Wellness visits by telephone will be conducted on days 21, 28, and 35 to follow-up on the patient's health status.

To conform with social distancing requirements, outpatient eating disorder treatment in Canada is being delivered virtually, but a lack of direction surrounding this change creates challenges for practitioners, patients, and families. As a result, there is an urgent need to not only adapt evidence-based care, including family-based treatment (FBT), to virtual formats, but to study its implementation in eating disorder programs. We propose to study the initial adaptation and adoption of virtual family-based treatment (vFBT) with the ultimate goal of improving access to services for youth with eating disorders.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We will use a multi-site case study with a mixed method pre/post design to examine the impact of our implementation approach across four pediatric eating disorder programs. We will develop implementation teams at each site (consisting of therapists, medical practitioners, and program administrators), provide a remote training workshop on vFBT, and offer ongoing consultation during the initial implementation phase. Therapists will submit videorecordings of their first four vFBT sessions. We propose to study our implementation approach by examining (1) whether the key components of standard FBT are maintained in virtual delivery measured by therapist self-report, (2) fidelity to our vFBT model measured by expert fidelity rating of submitted videorecordings of the first four sessions of vFBT, (3) team and patient/family experiences with vFBT assessed with qualitative interviews, and (4) patient outcomes measured by weight and binge/purge frequency reported by therapists.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an implementation strategy for virtually delivered FBT for eating disorders. Challenges to date include confirming site participation and obtaining ethics approval at all locations. This research is imperative to inform the delivery of vFBT in the COVID-19 context. It also has implications for delivery in a post-pandemic era where virtual services may be preferable to patients and families living in remote locations, where access to specialized services is extremely limited.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04678843 , registered on December 21, 2020.</AbstractText>",NCT04678843,Abstract,2/9/2021,10/31/2021,Interventional,Adapting and Adopting Highly Specialized Pediatric Eating Disorder Treatment to Virtual Care: Implementation Research for the COVID-19 Context and Beyond,Enrolling by invitation,Early Phase 1,McMaster University,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33832543,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04678843,1,0,1,0,NA,Canada,0,1,Virtual Family-Based Treatment,0,1.5028

After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7 Â± 2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN-Î± were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN-Î± levels. A significant increase in blood IFN-Î± was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population).

This is followed by a slower but targeted and specific response termed the adaptive or acquired immune response. There is emerging evidence that dietary components, including yeast-derived Î²-glucans, can aid host defense against pathogens by modulating inflammatory and antimicrobial activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Innate immune training refers to a newly recognized phenomenon wherein compounds may ""train"" innate immune cells, such that monocyte and macrophage precursor biology is altered to mount a more effective immunological response. Although various human studies have been carried out, much uncertainty still exists and further studies are required to fully elucidate the relationship between Î²-glucan supplementation and human immune function. This review offers an up-to-date report on yeast-derived Î²-glucans as immunomodulators, including a brief overview of the current paradigm regarding the interaction of Î²-glucans with the immune system. The recent pre-clinical work that has partly decrypted mode of action and the newest evidence from human trials are also reviewed. According to pre-clinical studies, Î²-1,3/1,6-glucan derived from baker's yeast may offer increased immuno-surveillance, although the human evidence is weaker than that gained from pre-clinical studies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020. All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria. We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients. The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma. Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality. Well-designed large multicenter clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04488484,Registry,7/1/2020,12/31/2021,Interventional,Medical and Serological Follow-up of the Staff of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group Infected With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.,"Active, not recruiting",N/A,Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32356910,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04488484,0,5,5,0,NA,France,0,1,Serology test follow-up,0,1.4962

The Delphi method was used to reach a consensus of a large panel of 51 experts: emergency physicians, geriatricians, infectious disease specialists, and ethical consultants. A preliminary list of eligible criteria was compiled based on a literature review. Four rounds of anonymized expert consultations were performed. The experts were asked to score each item as relevant, possibly relevant and non-relevant, as major or minor, and to choose the cut-off. They were also able make suggestions and remarks. Eight criteria constituting the HOME-CoV were selected: six correspond to the severity of clinical signs, one to the clinical course (clinically significant worsening within the last 24Â h), and the last corresponds to the association of a severe comorbidity and an inadequate living context. Hospitalization is deemed necessary if a patient meets one or more of the criteria.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

Traditionally, the pulmonary arterial systolic pressure has been estimated on echo by utilising the simplified Bernoulli equation from the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and adding this to an estimate of right atrial pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between this estimate of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure and that obtained from invasive measurement across a cohort of patients. However, for an individual patient significant overestimation and underestimation can occur and the levels of agreement between the two is poor. Recent guidance has suggested that echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary hypertension should be limited to determining the probability of pulmonary hypertension being present rather than estimating the pulmonary artery pressure. In those patients in whom the presence of pulmonary hypertension requires confirmation, this should be done with right heart catheterisation when indicated. This guideline protocol from the British Society of Echocardiography aims to outline a practical approach to assessing the probability of pulmonary hypertension using echocardiography and should be used in conjunction with the previously published minimum dataset for a standard transthoracic echocardiogram.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2018 The British Society of Echocardiography.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04998253,Registry,10/1/2020,11/30/2020,Interventional,Effects in Oxygenation and Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction in ARDS Secondary to SARS-CoV2,Completed,Early Phase 1,Unidad Temporal COVID-19 en Centro Citibanamex,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30012832,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04998253,0,36,36,0,NA,Mexico,0,1,Effects in oxygenation and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction,0,1.4919

As experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimising ventilatory management. Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the current paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that 2.9% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.5% of those infected die (95% credible interval: 0.3 to 0.9%), ranging from 0.001% in those under 20 years of age to 8.3% in those 80 years of age or older.

The increasing awareness of the adverse effects of both strong and weak respiratory efforts during mechanical ventilation on patient outcome brings attention to the respiratory drive of the critically ill patient. Critical illness can affect patients' respiratory drive through multiple pathways, mainly operating through three feedback systems: cortical, metabolic, and chemical. The chemical feedback system, defined as the response of the respiratory center's output to changes in arterial blood gases and pH, is one of the most important determinants of respiratory drive. The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to describe the determinants of respiratory drive in critically ill patients, review the tools available to assess respiratory drive at the bedside, and discuss the implications of altered respiratory drive during mechanical ventilation. An analysis that relates arterial carbon dioxide levels with brain's response to this stimulus will be presented, contrasting the brain's responses to the patient's ability to generate effective alveolar ventilation, both during unassisted breathing and with different modes of ventilatory assist. This analysis may facilitate comprehension of the pathophysiology of respiratory drive in critically ill patients.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.

Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.

Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">National Key R&amp;D Program of China.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, development of more immunogenic vaccine alternatives to using aluminium-based adjuvants is one of the most important phases of vaccination development. Among different sources of carbohydrate polymers, including plants, microbes and synthetic sources tested, glucans were found to be the most promising vaccine adjuvant, as they alone stimulate various immune reactions including antibody production without any negative side effects. The use of glucan particles as a delivery system is a viable option based on the documented efficient antigen loading and receptor-targeted uptake in antigen-presenting cells. In addition to particles, soluble glucans can be used as novel hydrogels or as direct immunocyte-targeting delivery systems employing novel complexes with oligodeoxynucleotides.

31933547,Journal Article, , ,Application of Low Doses of Ionizing Radiation in Medical Therapies.,9/30/2020,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,"<AbstractText>The discovery of X-rays and radioactivity in 1895/1896 triggered a flood of studies and applications of radiation in medicine that continues to this day. They started with imaging fractures/organs and progressed to treating diseases by exposing areas to radiation from external and internal sources. By definition, <i>low-dose</i> treatments stimulate damage control (or adaptive protection) systems that remedy diseases. Publications are identified on low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) therapies for different cancers, infections, inflammations, and autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. The high rate of endogenous DNA damage, due to leakage of oxygen from aerobic metabolism, and the damage control systems that deal with this are discussed. Their stimulation and inhibition by radiation are described. The radium dial painter studies revealed the radium ingestion threshold for malignancy and the dose threshold for bone sarcoma. The radiation scare that misled the medical profession and the public is a barrier to LDIR therapies. Many studies on nasal radium irradiation demonstrated that children are not unduly radiation sensitive. Omissions in the medical textbooks misinform physicians about the effects of LDIR therapy, which blocks clinical trials to determine optimal doses, efficacy, and thresholds for onset of harm. Information from many recent case reports on LDIR therapies, including successes with radon therapy, is provided.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04394182,Registry,4/21/2020,12/31/2020,Interventional,Ultra Low Doses of Therapy With Radiation Applicated to COVID-19,Recruiting,N/A,Fundacion GenesisCare,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31933547,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04394182,1,9,10,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Ultra-Low-dose radiotherapy|ventilatory support with oxygen therapy|Lopinavir/ritonavir|Hydroxychloroquine|Azithromycin|Piperacillin/tazobactam|Low molecular weight heparin|Corticosteroid injection|Tocilizumab,0,1.1037

The rationale for a cost-effective anti-inflammatory treatment.,9/28/2020,Clinical and translational radiation oncology,"<AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemia is affecting people worldwide. Most of the patients suffered of a respiratory disease that will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severely ill patients, develop a systemic inflammatory response with a Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), that is characterized by a sudden increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alfa by activated macrophages (M1 phenotype). Blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab and using respirator equipment seems to be a very important issue in this (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, but not all patients are referred to such treatments. Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype). Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals. This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04394182,Registry,4/21/2020,12/31/2020,Interventional,Ultra Low Doses of Therapy With Radiation Applicated to COVID-19,Recruiting,N/A,Fundacion GenesisCare,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32373721,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04394182,1,9,10,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Ultra-Low-dose radiotherapy|ventilatory support with oxygen therapy|Lopinavir/ritonavir|Hydroxychloroquine|Azithromycin|Piperacillin/tazobactam|Low molecular weight heparin|Corticosteroid injection|Tocilizumab,0,1.1036

A number of COVID-19 late phase trial platforms have been developed to investigate (often repurposed) drugs both in the UK and globally (e.g. RECOVERY led by the University of Oxford and SOLIDARITY led by WHO). There is a pressing need to investigate novel candidates within early phase trial platforms, from which promising candidates can feed into established later phase platforms. AGILE grew from a UK-wide collaboration to undertake early stage clinical evaluation of candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection to accelerate national and global healthcare interventions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS/DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">AGILE is a seamless phase I/IIa platform study to establish the optimum dose, determine the activity and safety of each candidate and recommend whether it should be evaluated further. Each candidate is evaluated in its own trial, either as an open label single arm healthy volunteer study or in patients, randomising between candidate and control usually in a 2:1 allocation in favour of the candidate. Each dose is assessed sequentially for safety usually in cohorts of 6 patients. Once a phase II dose has been identified, efficacy is assessed by seamlessly expanding into a larger cohort. AGILE is completely flexible in that the core design in the master protocol can be adapted for each candidate based on prior knowledge of the candidate (i.e. population, primary endpoint and sample size can be amended). This information is detailed in each candidate specific trial protocol of the master protocol.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Few approved treatments for COVID-19 are available such as dexamethasone, remdesivir and tocilizumab in hospitalised patients.

Data from these studies were collected and analyzed with the intent of estimating an optimal dosing range for RT that would induce an efficacious treatment response. RT was reported to be frequently effective after only a single treatment, with a rapid (within 24 h) and often long-lasting (from months to years) relief from symptoms. Over a two-decade span from the 1920s to the 1940s, the therapeutic responses to a single RT treatment consistently improved as the dosing for multiple ailments decreased over time to between 30 roentgen (r) and 100 r. These findings are significant and in agreement with a number of contemporary reports from Germany where RT has been commonly and successfully employed in treating ailments with an inflammatory origin. A proposed mechanism by which RT mitigates inflammation and facilitates healing is via the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory or M2 phenotype.</AbstractText>",NCT04394182,Registry,4/21/2020,12/31/2020,Interventional,Ultra Low Doses of Therapy With Radiation Applicated to COVID-19,Recruiting,N/A,Fundacion GenesisCare,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31060383,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04394182,1,9,10,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Ultra-Low-dose radiotherapy|ventilatory support with oxygen therapy|Lopinavir/ritonavir|Hydroxychloroquine|Azithromycin|Piperacillin/tazobactam|Low molecular weight heparin|Corticosteroid injection|Tocilizumab,0,1.0881

To date, symptomatic supportive care has been the most common treatment. It has been reported that the mechanism of COVID-19 is related to cytokine storms and subsequent immunogenic damage, especially damage to the endothelium and alveolar membrane. Vitamin C (VC), also known as L-ascorbic acid, has been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. A high dose of intravenous VC (HIVC) was proven to block several key components of cytokine storms, and HIVC showed safety and varying degrees of efficacy in clinical trials conducted on patients with bacterial-induced sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we hypothesise that HIVC could be added to the treatment of ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction related to COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">The investigators designed a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial that is planned to recruit 308 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred into the intensive care unit. Participants will randomly receive HIVC diluted in sterile water or placebo for 7 days once enrolled. Patients with a history of VC allergy, end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced malignancy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will be excluded. The primary outcome is ventilation-free days within 28 observational days. This is one of the first clinical trials applying HIVC to treat COVID-19, and it will provide credible efficacy and safety data. We predict that HIVC could suppress cytokine storms caused by COVID-19, help improve pulmonary function and reduce the risk of ARDS of COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (identifiers: Clinical Ethical Approval No. 2020001).

Vascular inflammation plays an important role in initiating and perpetuating atherosclerotic disease, specifically at the site of plaque and subsequent fibrous cap rupture. Both men and women succumb to this disease process, and although management strategies have focused on revascularization and pharmacological therapies in the acute situation to reverse vessel closure and prevent thrombogenesis, data now suggest that regulation of host inflammation may improve both morbidity and mortality, thus supporting the notion that prevention is better than cure. There is a clear sex difference in the incidence of vascular disease, and data confirm biological differences in inflammatory initiation and resolution between men and women. This article reviews contemporary opinions describing the sex difference in the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses, with a view to explore potential targets for pharmacological intervention.</AbstractText>",NCT04889274,Registry,5/10/2021,8/1/2021,Interventional,Investigation of the Effects of Dietary Nitrate and Sex on COVID-19 Vaccine Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Healthy Men and Women (DiNOVasc-COVID-19),Recruiting,Phase 1,Queen Mary University of London,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33035428,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889274,0,3,3,0,NA,United Kingdom,0,0,COVID-19 vaccine|Concentrate beetroot Juice|Nitrate-deplete beetroot juice,1,1.0281

However, this view has been radically revised over the past decade and more. Much evidence has now accumulated demonstrating that nitrite serves as a storage form of nitric oxide, releasing nitric oxide preferentially under acidic and/or hypoxic conditions but also occurring under physiologic conditions: a phenomenon that is catalyzed by a number of distinct mammalian nitrite reductases. Importantly, preclinical studies demonstrate that reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide results in a number of beneficial effects, including vasodilatation of blood vessels and lowering of blood pressure, as well as cytoprotective effects that limit the extent of damage caused by an ischemia/reperfusion insult, with this latter issue having been translated more recently to the clinical setting. In addition, research has demonstrated that the other main metabolite of the oxidation of nitric oxide (i.e., nitrate) can also be sequentially reduced through processing in vivo to nitrite and then nitrite to nitric oxide to exert a range of beneficial effects-most notably lowering of blood pressure, a phenomenon that has also been confirmed recently to be an effective method for blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension. This review will provide a detailed description of the pathways involved in the bioactivation of both nitrate and nitrite in vivo, their functional effects in preclinical models, and their mechanisms of action, as well as a discussion of translational exploration of this pathway in diverse disease states characterized by deficiencies in bioavailable nitric oxide. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The past 15 years has seen a major revision in our understanding of the pathways for nitric oxide synthesis in the body with the discovery of the noncanonical pathway for nitric oxide generation known as the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. This review describes the molecular components of this pathway, its role in physiology, potential therapeutics of targeting this pathway, and their impact in experimental models, as well as the clinical translation (past and future) and potential side effects.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 by The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04889274,Registry,5/10/2021,8/1/2021,Interventional,Investigation of the Effects of Dietary Nitrate and Sex on COVID-19 Vaccine Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Healthy Men and Women (DiNOVasc-COVID-19),Recruiting,Phase 1,Queen Mary University of London,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32576603,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889274,0,3,3,0,NA,United Kingdom,0,0,COVID-19 vaccine|Concentrate beetroot Juice|Nitrate-deplete beetroot juice,1,1.0225

Patients who died with either PCR-confirmed or radiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection were consecutively included. MIA consisted of whole-body CT and CT-guided Tru-CutÂ® biopsies. Diagnostic modalities were clinical chart review, radiology, microbiology, and histopathology which were assessed by two independent experts per modality. MIA COD and contributing diagnoses were established during a multi-disciplinary meeting. Clinical COD (CCOD) and contributing diagnosis were abstracted from the discharge letter. The main outcomes were alterations in CCOD and contributing diagnoses after MIA, and the contribution of each diagnostic modality. We included 18 patients, of which 7 after intensive care unit hospitalization. MIA led to an alteration in 15/18 (83%) patients. The CCOD was altered in 5/18 (28%) patients. MIA found a new COD (1/5), a more specific COD (1/5), a less certain COD (1/5), or a contributing diagnosis to be the COD (2/5). Contributing diagnoses were altered in 14/18 (78%) patients: 9 new diagnoses, 5 diagnoses dismissed, 3 made more specific, and 2 made less certain. Overall, histopathology contributed in 14/15 (93%) patients with alterations, radiology and microbiology each in 6/15 (40%), and clinical review in 3/15 (20%).

It is not always limited to just paid employment. Occupations of the global population have been adversely affected in one way or the other because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Four different key sects of occupations were majorly affected. These are the occupations of those who are or were COVID-positive, occupations of healthy individuals affected by COVID-19/lockdown, occupations of the population highly susceptible and vulnerable of contracting COVID-19 and occupations having a direct impact on global market, supply chain or economy. These occupations were locked up due to the pandemic lockdown. Occupational therapists can scientifically analyse occupations and help formulate exit strategies for the lockdown. They are experts who understand and study the different ways of measuring participation in occupation to develop innovative strategies and therapeutic interventions to facilitate individuals' engagement in occupations. They can unravel the pragmatic strategies for preventing transmission (physical distancing, hand hygiene, personal protective equipmentÂ usage and decontamination) despite engaging in occupations safely and effectively.

We aimed to evaluate three conventional PEEP strategies on their effects on respiratory mechanics, gas exchanges, and hemodynamics. <b>Methods:</b> This is a prospective, physiologic, multicenter study conducted in China. We recruited 20 intubated subjects with ARDS and confirmed COVID-19. We first set PEEP by the ARDSnet low PEEP-fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>) table. After a recruitment maneuver, PEEP was set at 15, 10, and 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for 10 min, respectively. Among these three PEEP levels, best-compliance PEEP was the one providing the highest respiratory system compliance; best-oxygenation PEEP was the one providing the highest PaO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of arterial oxygen)/FIO<sub>2</sub>. <b>Results:</b> At each PEEP level, we assessed respiratory mechanics, arterial blood gas, and hemodynamics. Among three PEEP levels, plateau pressure, driving pressure, mechanical power, and blood pressure improved with lower PEEP. The ARDSnet low PEEP-FIO<sub>2</sub> table and the best-oxygenation strategies provided higher PEEP than the best-compliance strategy (11 Â± 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O vs. 11 Â± 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O vs. 6 Â± 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, <i>p</i> = 0.001), leading to higher plateau pressure, driving pressure, and mechanical power. The three PEEP strategies were not significantly different in gas exchange. The subgroup analysis showed that three PEEP strategies generated different effects in subjects with moderate or severe ARDS (<i>n</i> = 12) but not in subjects with mild ARDS (<i>n</i> = 8). <b>Conclusions:</b> In our cohort with COVID-19-induced ARDS, the ARDSnet low PEEP/FIO<sub>2</sub> table and the best-oxygenation strategies led to higher PEEP and potentially higher risk of ventilator-induced lung injury than the best-compliance strategy. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04359251.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Pan, Lu, She, Ren, Wei, Xu, Huang, Xia, Yu, Chen, Du and Qiu.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04359251,Abstract,3/5/2020,3/25/2020,Interventional,Different PEEP Settings of COVID-19 Induced ARDS,Completed,N/A,"Southeast University, China",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34355001,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04359251,1,0,1,0,NA,China,0,0,Gas exchanges at different PEEP|lung mechanics at different PEEP|Hemodynamics changes at different PEEP,0,1.0096

Several variants of concern have emerged including those in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 can cause a dysregulated inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm, which can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death. Suppressing these cytokine elevations may be key to improving outcomes. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a simple, non-invasive procedure whereby a blood pressure cuff is inflated and deflated on the upper arm for several cycles. ""RIC in COVID-19"" is a pilot, multi-center, randomized clinical trial, designed to ascertain whether RIC suppresses inflammatory cytokine production.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A minimum of 55 adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, but not of critical status, will be enrolled from centers in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa.

Currently, patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19 have better prognosis than during the first period of the pandemic due to improved treatment. However, the overall societal susceptibility of being infected makes it pivotal to prevent severe courses of disease to avoid high mortality rates and collapse of the healthcare systems. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) self-care is used in chronic pulmonary disease and has been shown to prevent pneumonia in a high-risk cohort of patients with leukaemia. PEP flute self-care to prevent respiratory deterioration and hospitalisation in early COVID-19: a randomised trial (The PEP-CoV trial) examines the effectiveness on respiratory symptoms and need of hospital admission by regular PEP flute use among non-hospitalised individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">In this randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that daily PEP flute usage as add-on to usual care is superior to usual care as regards symptom severity measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at 30-day follow-up (primary outcome) and hospital admission through register data (secondary outcome). We expect to recruit 400 individuals for the trial. Participants in the intervention group receive a kit of 2 PEP flutes and adequate resistances and access to instruction videos. A telephone hotline offers possible contact to a nurse. The eight-item CAT score measures cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnoea, activities of daily living at home, feeling safe at home despite symptoms, sleep quality and vigour.

The three primary predictors of interest-language preference, smartphone ownership, and type of clinic for usual care-were adjusted for age, gender, race or ethnicity, limited English proficiency, educational attainment, health literacy, and health status. Three outcomes focused on use of email, SMS text message, or phone apps to communicate with clinicians. The two other outcomes were use of Web-based health videos or online health support groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Nearly one-third of participants watched Web-based health videos (367/1027, 35.74%) or used emails to communicate with their clinician (318/1027, 30.96%).

Relative to English-speaking survey respondents, individuals who preferred Chinese had lower odds of texting their clinician (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.79), whereas Spanish-speaking survey respondents had lower odds of using apps to communicate with clinicians (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.75) or joining an online support group (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.92). Respondents who received care from a clinic affiliated with the integrated safety net, academic tertiary medical center, or integrated payer-provider systems had higher odds than individuals without a usual source of care at using emails, SMS text messages, or apps to communicate with clinicians.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In vulnerable populations, smartphone ownership increases the use of many forms of technology for health purposes, but device ownership itself is not sufficient to increase the use of all technologies for communicating with clinicians. Language preference impacts the use of technology for health purposes even after considering English proficiency. Health system factors impact patients' use of technology-enabled approaches for communicating with clinicians. No single factor was associated with higher odds of using technology for all health purposes; therefore, existing disparities in the use of digital health tools among diverse and vulnerable populations can only be addressed using a multipronged approach.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Elaine C Khoong, Natalie A Rivadeneira, Robert A Hiatt, Urmimala Sarkar.

Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the ""COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker"" (""Tracker"") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the ""Tracker"" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2Â S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01. Ongoing clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies will help define the utility of these antibodies as a new class of therapeutics for treating COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Antibody Therapeutics 2020.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04931238,Registry,1/20/2021,12/31/2021,Interventional,"Tolerability,Safety of JS016 in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)",Recruiting,Phase 1,Peking Union Medical College Hospital,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33215063,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04931238,0,1,1,0,NA,China,0,0,Combination Product: JS016 (anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody),0,1.0038

Depending on the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, the NLRP3 inflammasome can play a crucial role during innate immunity activation. To date, studies describing the NLRP3 response during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients are lacking. We prospectively monitored caspase-1 activation levels in peripheral myeloid cells from healthy donors and patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The caspase-1 activation potential in response to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation was opposed between nonclassical monocytes and CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes had decreased nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential associated with an increased percentage of NLRP3 inflammasome impaired immature neutrophils and a loss of eosinophils in the blood. In patients who recovered from COVID-19, nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential in CD66b+CD16dim cells was restored and the proportion of immature neutrophils was similar to control. Here, we reveal that NLRP3 inflammasome activation potential differs among myeloid cells and could be used as a biomarker of a COVID-19 patient's evolution. This assay could be a useful tool to predict patient outcome.

Currently, most diagnoses use the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT). However, challenges exist with CT use due to infection control, lack of CT availability in low- and middle-income countries, and low RT-PCR sensitivity. Passive microwave radiometry (MWR), a cheap, non-radioactive, and portable technology, has been used for cancer and other diseases' diagnoses. Here, we tested MWR use first time for the early diagnosis of pulmonary COVID-19 complications in a cross-sectional controlled trial in order to evaluate MWR use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy individuals. We measured the skin and internal temperature using 30 points identified on the body, for both lungs. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by both CT scan and doctors' diagnoses (pneumonia+/pneumonia-). COVID-19 was determined by RT-PCR (covid+/covid-). The best MWR results were obtained for the pneumonia-/covid- and pneumonia+/covid+ groups. The study suggests that MWR could be used for diagnosing pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Since MWR is inexpensive, its use will ease the financial burden for both patients and countries.

In more severe cases, patients remain hospitalized for several days under treatment of the health team. Thus, it is important to develop and use technologies with the aim to strengthen conventional therapy by encouraging movement, physical activity, and improving cardiorespiratory fitness for patients. In this sense, therapies for exposure to virtual reality (VR) are promising and have been shown to be an adequate and equivalent alternative to conventional exercise programs. <b>Aim:</b> This is a study protocol with the aim of comparing the conventional physical therapy intervention with the use of a non-immersive VR software during COVID-19 hospitalization. <b>Methods:</b> Fifty patients hospitalized with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be divided in two groups under physiotherapy treatment using conventional or VR intervention: Group A: participants with COVID-19 will start the first day of the protocol with VR tasks in the morning and then in the second period, in the afternoon, will perform the conventional exercises (<i>n</i> = 25) and Group B: participants with COVID-19 will start the first day with conventional exercises in the morning and in the second period, in the afternoon, will perform activity with VR (<i>n</i> = 25). All participants will be evaluated with different motor and physiologic scales before and after the treatment to measure improvements. <b>Conclusion:</b> Considering the importance of benefits from physical activity during hospitalization, VR software shows promise as a potential mechanism for improving physical activity.

However, effective pharmacological treatments to combat sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia are not available.

In addition, TH has favorable effects on the immune system and viral load in infected tissue.

Mindfulness-based interventions have shown effectiveness in reducing stress and fostering resilience and recovery in healthcare workers. There are no studies examining the feasibility of brief mindfulness-based interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This is an exploratory study with a post intervention assessment. We describe an on-site brief mindfulness intervention and evaluate its helpfulness, safety, and feasibility. <b>Results:</b> One thousand out of 7,000 (14%) healthcare workers from La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (Spain) participated in at least one session. One hundred and fifty out of 1,000 (15%) participants filled out a self-report questionnaire evaluating the helpfulness of the intervention for on-site stress reduction. Ninety two subjects (61%) participated in more than one session. Most of the participants were women (80%) with a mean age of 38.6 years. Almost half of the sample were nurses (46%). Sessions were perceived as being helpful with a mean rating of 8.4 on a scale from 0 to 10. Only 3 people (2%) reported a minor adverse effect (increased anxiety or dizziness). <b>Discussion:</b> Our data supports the utility, safety and feasibility of an on-site, brief mindfulness-based intervention designed to reduce stress for frontline health workers during a crisis.

The hypothesis is that by using remote CGM to monitor glucose levels of COVID-19 infected patients and patients with other contagious infections with diabetes, we can still provide satisfactory (and maybe even better) in-hospital diabetes management despite patients being quarantined. Furthermore, the number of patient-personnel contacts can be lowered compared to standard monitoring with finger-prick glucose.

Antidepressants (AD), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and behavioral activation (BA) are the main treatments for MDD. Trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT) addresses and restructures dysfunctional negative core beliefs (CBs) and is a novel and promising approach.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of TBCT, BA and treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of MDD.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A total of 76 patients with MDD were randomized into 1 of 3 groups and evaluated at baseline, after 6 weeks and at week 12 (final evaluation). The primary outcome was changing in HAM-D scores, and the secondary outcomes included scores on the BDI, CD-Quest, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and WHOQOL.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Both TBCT and BA (which also included AD) were different from TAU (which included antidepressants alone) in reducing the HAM-D and BDI scores and other measures. TBCT and BA were different from TAU in the reduction of disability in SDS and WHOQOL physical domain scores. Besides limited by a small sample size, the dropout rate in the TAU arm was higher, and only 10 patients completed the 3 evaluations.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This trial provides evidence that TBCT and BA combined with antidepressants were more efficacious than the TAU (drug alone) in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms and disability, showing that this combination can be useful for clinical practice.</AbstractText>",NCT04852770,Registry,4/23/2021,9/30/2021,Interventional,"Efficacy of TBCT, MBHP and PPT for PTSD During the Covid-19 Pandemics",Recruiting,N/A,FundaÃ§Ã£o Bahiana de Infectologia,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31769377,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04852770,0,14,14,0,NA,Brazil,0,0,Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy|Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion|Positive psychotherapy,0,0.9955

The three intervention arms will all receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing of symptomatic participants (as in the comparator group) in addition to one of the following: 1. Once weekly self-collected oral swabs (OS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 2. Once weekly self-collected oral-nares swab (O-NS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 3. Once weekly nurse collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) regardless of symptoms. Participants will follow verbal and written instructions for the collection of OS and O-NS specimens. For OS collection, participants are instructed to first moisten the swab on their tongue, insert the swab between the cheek and the lower gums and rotate the swab three times. This is repeated on the other side. For O-NS collection, after oral collection, the swab is inserted comfortably (about 2-3 cm) into one nostril, parallel to the floor and turned three times, then repeated in the other nostril. NPS specimens were collected by the nurse following standard of care procedure. All swabs were placed into a viral inactivation medium and transported to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens and then amplified by RT-PCR for the UTR and Envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human RNase P gene, which is used as a sample adequacy marker.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">1.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""PRIMARY OUTCOME"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">COVID-19 detection rate, i.e. the number of new positive cases over the study period of 8 weeks in each arm of the study. 2.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""SECONDARY OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Qualitative assessment of study enrollment over 8 weeks.

To date, only a few studies have evaluated the safety of using lungs from these donors for transplantation, and no direct interventions to donor organs have been done with the aim of preventing HCV transmission via organ transplantation. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of lung transplantation in humans from HCV-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients after application of ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) plus ultraviolet C (UVC) perfusate irradiation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We did a single centre, prospective, open-label, non-randomised trial in which donor lungs from HCV-viraemic donors (HCV-positive) were transplanted into HCV-negative recipients at Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network (Toronto, ON, Canada). Donors were younger than 65 years old and tested positive for HCV by nucleic acid testing. Donors who tested positive for hepatitis B virus, HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 or 2 were excluded. Recipients were on the lung transplant waiting list without significant liver disease (stage 2 fibrosis or higher were excluded) or active HCV infection. Before implantation, all HCV-positive donor lungs were treated with EVLP with or without UVC perfusate irradiation to reduce the concentration of HCV RNA and infectivity. For the first week after transplantation, patients' HCV RNA blood concentrations were measured once daily, then once per week for 12 weeks. All patients received 12 weeks of oral sofosbuvir 400 mg plus velpatasvir 100 mg, starting at least 2 weeks after transplantation. The primary endpoint was a composite of survival and HCV-free status at 6 months after transplantation in all patients who received HCV-positive lungs. Patient outcomes such as survival, time in hospital, and incidence of acute rejection were compared between those receiving HCV-positive lungs and all patients who received HCV-negative lung transplants during the study period. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03112044.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">From Oct 1, 2017, to Nov 1, 2018, 209 patients had a transplantation; of 27 donors who were HCV-positive and initially considered, 22 were suitable for transplantation. The remaining 187 donors were HCV-negative. Before implantation, 11 of the HCV-positive donor lungs were treated with EVLP alone and the other 11 were treated with EVLP plus UVC. Lung disease, urgency status, and positive donor-recipient HLA crossmatch were similar between the patients who received HCV-positive and HCV-negative lungs. 20 (91%) patients in the HCV-positive group developed HCV viraemia within the first week after transplantation and had sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir treatment, starting at a median of 21 days after transplantation (IQR 16Â·76-24Â·75). Donor organ treatment with EVLP plus UVC was associated with significantly lower recipient viral loads in blood within the first week after transplantation than with EVLP alone (median of 167 IU/mL [IQR 20-12â€ˆ000] vs 4390 IU/mL [1170-112â€ˆ000] at day 7; p=0Â·048) and prevented transmission in two (18%) of 11 patients. All 20 infected patients achieved negative HCV PCR within 6 weeks of treatment initiation. The primary endpoint of survival and HCV-free status at 6 months after transplantation was achieved in 19 (86%) of 22 patients in the HCV-positive group. 6-month survival was 95% in recipients receiving lungs from HCV-viraemic donors versus 94% in recipients receiving lungs from HCV-negative donors. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the HCV-positive group were respiratory complications (five [23%]) and infections (four [18%]). Serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital occurred in ten (45%) patients. One (5%) patient who did not develop HCV infection died at day 31 from multiorgan failure related to pseudomonas sepsis. Two patients presented with HCV relapse within 3 months after sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir completion and required retreatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Early and intermediate clinical outcomes were not significantly different between patients receiving viraemic HCV donor lungs and HCV-negative donor lungs. Donor organ treatment with UVC perfusate irradiation during EVLP significantly decreased HCV viral loads within the first 7 days after transplantation and shows the proof-of-concept for a novel approach of minimising viral load ex vivo before transplantation, with intent of preventing donor-recipient transmission.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The most common symptoms were cough (89.4%), fever (85.6%), and sore throat (81.6%); 20.1% of the patients had underlying comorbidities. Hypertension was seen in 8.8% and diabetes in 7.6% of all the cases. The percentage of cases with temperatures &gt;38Ö¯C was 20.3% (n = 129), and 1.6% of patients had heart rates â‰¥125 beats/min and 4.7% of them had respiratory rates of &gt;24 breaths/min.

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease.

Substantial research then found that well-being causes many external benefits, including better physical and mental health. Among the applications of Positive Psychology are national psychological accounts of well-being, Positive Psychotherapy, the classification of strengths and virtues, Comprehensive Soldier Fitness, and Positive Education. Positive Psychology has spread beyond psychology into neuroscience, health, psychiatry, theology, and even to the humanities. Positive Psychology has many critics, and I comment on the strongest criticisms.

To date there are no studies in the literature that demonstrate its feasibility and efficacy in the context of the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Based upon the little existing evidence, we planned to assess the efficacy of the infusion of hyperimmune plasma in COVID-19 patients in a one-arm proof-of-concept clinical trial. The primary objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of plasma taken from convalescent donors of COVID-19 to critically ill patients with COVID-19 in terms of their survival. Death from any cause will be considered. The main limit of this study is its one-arm proof-of-concept design with only 43 patients enrolled. However, in the absence of previous evidence, larger and/or randomized trials did not appear to be ethically acceptable. Moreover, the results from this study, if encouraging, will allow us to plan further informed large clinical trials.

Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6â€‰months after hospital discharge.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups.

A UK-wide cohort study tracking changes in families' mental health since early lockdown (Co-SPACE) found a significant rise in primary school-aged children's behaviour problems and associated family-related stress. Three-quarters of parents in Co-SPACE also reported wanting extra support. In SPARKLE, we will examine whether providing Co-SPACE families with a smartphone application delivering information and parenting support, Parent Positive, can reverse the negative effects of the pandemic on children and parents. The efficacy on child and parent outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Parent Positive will be examined. We will also test whether the effects are moderated by pre-existing levels of child conduct problems and usage of Parent Positive. Exploratory analyses will examine whether other baseline characteristics or lockdown circumstances moderate the effects of Parent Positive.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">SPARKLE is a two-arm superiority parallel group randomised controlled trial embedded in an existing large UK-wide self-selected community cohort - Co-SPACE.

Co-designed with parents and based on decades of parenting research, Parent Positive consists of three elements: (i) Parenting Boosters: where advice, delivered in the form of narrated animations, videos, graphics and text is provided to help parents with eight common parenting challenges; (ii) Parenting Exchange: a facilitated parent-to-parent communication and peer support platform and; (iii) Parent Resources: giving access to carefully selected high-quality, evidence-based online parenting resources. Follow-up as Usual: FAU was selected as a comparator because the public health nature meant that an active comparator was not appropriate due to the pragmatic, rapid implementation of the trial. Individuals randomised to FAU will receive no intervention for the first two months while the data for baseline (T1), T2 and T3 are collected.

The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various stressors that require adjustment in everyday life and possibly changes in personal future prospects. While some individuals cope well with these challenges, some develop psychological distress including depressive symptoms, anxiety, or stress. Internet-based self-help interventions have proven to be effective in the treatment of various mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Based on that, we developed an internet-based self-help program for individuals with psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3-week self-help program consists of 6 modules comprising texts, videos, figures, and exercises. Participants can request guidance within the self-help program (guidance on demand). The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the self-help program compared to a waiting control condition.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The design is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants are allocated to a 3-week self-help intervention plus care as usual or a 3-week waiting period with only care as usual. There are follow-ups after 6â€‰weeks and 18â€‰weeks. At least 80 participants with COVID-19 pandemic related psychological distress will be recruited. Primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

The therapeutic approaches used to treat these patients are not always available, may be not be accepted by some patients, and often require face-to-face interactions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The main aim of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based adjuvant lifestyle-based intervention for patients with TRD.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This will be a parallel, randomized, and controlled clinical trial. A total of 180 patients with TRD will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 groups: treatment prescribed by the mental health team and written suggestions for lifestyle changes (placebo control group); treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (active control group); or treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week lifestyle change promotion program (intervention group). We will perform this study during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will administer interventions by teletherapy, and contact participants by telephone calls, text messages, and/or teleconferences. We will collect patient data using questionnaires administered at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The secondary outcomes will be score on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (used to quantify and track patient progress and treatment response over time) and health-related quality of life measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Patients with TRD are especially vulnerable when face-to-face psychotherapy is unavailable. The main strength of the proposed study is the novelty of the intervention to be used as an adjuvant therapy. Our results may provide guidance for treatment of patients with TRD in future situations that require lockdown measures.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CLINICALTRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBER"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">NCT04428099.</AbstractText>",NCT04428099,Abstract,1/13/2020,1/12/2022,Interventional,Healthy Lifestyle Promotion as Adjunctive Teletherapy for Treatment-resistant Major Depression,Recruiting,N/A,University of the Balearic Islands,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33157937,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04428099,1,0,1,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Lifestyle change promotion program|Mindfullness based cognitive program|Written Information,0,0.0349
