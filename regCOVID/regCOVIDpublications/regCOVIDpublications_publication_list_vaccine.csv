Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19).

Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? <i>Discussions</i>. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution.

Eligibility criteria for people with HIV included being on antiretroviral therapy for at least 3 months, with a plasma HIV viral load of less than 1000 copies per mL. In this interim analysis, safety and reactogenicity was assessed in all individuals who received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCov 19 between enrolment and Jan 15, 2021.

In participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, there were 164 adverse events in those with HIV (86 vaccine; 78 placebo) and 237 in HIV-negative participants (95 vaccine; 142 placebo). Of seven serious adverse events, one severe fever in a HIV-negative participant was definitely related to trial intervention and one severely elevated alanine aminotranferase in a participant with HIV was unlikely related; five others were deemed unrelated. One person with HIV died (unlikely related). People with HIV and HIV-negative participants showed vaccine-induced serum IgG responses against wild-type Wuhan-1 Asp614Gly (also known as D614G). For participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antigens at baseline, full-length spike geometric mean concentration (GMC) at day 28 was 163Â·7 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL (95% CI 89Â·9-298Â·1) for people with HIV (n=36) and 112Â·3 BAU/mL (61Â·7-204Â·4) for HIV-negative participants (n=23), with a rising day 42 GMC booster response in both groups. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive people with HIV demonstrated higher antibody responses after each vaccine dose than did people with HIV who were seronegative at baseline. High-level binding antibody cross-reactivity for the full-length spike and receptor-binding domain of the beta variant (B.1.351) was seen regardless of HIV status.

ACOV2S results (shown in U/mL - equivalent to BAU/mL per the first WHO international standard) were compared with results from ELISAs specific to antibodies against the Spike protein (S-2P) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as neutralization tests including nanoluciferase (nLUC <sub>80</sub> ), live-virus (PRNT <sub>80</sub> ), and a pseudovirus neutralizing antibody assay (PsVNA <sub>50</sub> ).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">RBD-specific antibodies were already detectable by ACOV2S at the first time point of assessment (d15 after first vaccination), with seroconversion before in all but 2 participants (25 Î¼g dose group); all had seroconverted by Day 29. Across all post-baseline visits, geometric mean concentration of antibody levels were 3.27-7.48-fold higher in the 100 Î¼g compared with the 25 Î¼g dose group. ACOV2S measurements were highly correlated with those from RBD ELISA (Pearson's r=0.938; p&lt;0.0001) and S-2P ELISA (r=0.918; p&lt;0.0001). For both ELISAs, heterogeneous baseline results and smaller increases in antibody levels following the second vs first vaccination compared with ACOV2S were observed. ACOV2S showed absence of any baseline noise indicating high specificity detecting vaccine-induced antibody response. Moderate-strong correlations were observed between ACOV2S and neutralization tests (nLUC <sub>80</sub> r=0.933; PsVNA <sub>50</sub> , r=0.771; PRNT <sub>80</sub> , r=0.672; all pâ‰¤0.0001).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (ACOV2S) can be regarded as a highly valuable method to assess and quantify the presence of RBD-directed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination, and may indicate the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

However, these nanomedicines need to overcome several physiological barriers intrinsic to the tumor microenvironment (TME) before reaching their target. Intrinsic tumor genetic/phenotypic variations, along with intratumor heterogeneity, provide different cues to each cancer type, making each patient with cancer unique. This brings additional challenges in translating nanotechnology-based systems into clinically reliable therapies. To develop efficient therapeutic strategies, it is important to understand the dynamic interactions between TME players and the complex mechanisms involved, because they constitute invaluable targets to dismantle tumor progression. In this review, we discuss the latest nanotechnology-based strategies for cancer diagnosis and therapy as well as the potential targets for the design of future anticancer nanomedicines.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2Â·2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever â‰¥37Â·8Â°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24â€ˆ422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17â€ˆ178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66Â·7% (95% CI 57Â·4-74Â·0), with 84 (1Â·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2Â·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0Â·9%) of 12â€ˆ282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1Â·1%) of 11â€ˆ962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76Â·0% (59Â·3-85Â·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0Â·66 [95% CI 0Â·59-0Â·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81Â·3% [95% CI 60Â·3-91Â·2] at â‰¥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55Â·1% [33Â·0-69Â·9] at &lt;6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 2Â·32 [2Â·01-2Â·68]).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemann Foundation, Rede D'Or, the Brava and Telles Foundation, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. <sup>5,6</sup>). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)<sup>7</sup> given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-Î± cytokine secretion by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced.

The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or â‰¥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 Î¼g or 100 Î¼g of vaccine administered 28 days apart.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-Î¼g dose, the anti-S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-Î¼g dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-Î¼g dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-Î¼g dose, which supports the use of the 100-Î¼g dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged â‰¥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2Â·2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3Â·5-6Â·5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged â‰¥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20â€ˆ713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13â€ˆ898-33â€ˆ550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16â€ˆ170 AU/mL [10â€ˆ233-40â€ˆ353], n=26; and â‰¥70 years 17â€ˆ561 AU/mL [9705-37â€ˆ796], n=47; p=0Â·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and â‰¥70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0Â·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (&gt;99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and â‰¥70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose.

Approximately, the first 400 participants meeting the main study entry criteria-with no contraindications to influenza vaccination-were invited to join the substudy. Participants of the main study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two intramuscular injections of either NVX-CoV2373 (5 Î¼g) or placebo (normal saline) 21 days apart; participants enrolled into the substudy were co-vaccinated with a single (0Â·5 mL) intramuscular, age-appropriate (quadrivalent influenza cell-based vaccine [Flucelvax Quadrivalent; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those aged 18-64 years and adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine [Fluad; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those â‰¥65 years), licensed, influenza vaccine on the opposite deltoid to that of the first study vaccine dose or placebo. The influenza vaccine was administered in an open-label manner and at the same time as the first study injection. Reactogenicity was evaluated via an electronic diary for 7 days after vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events, medically attended adverse events, and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was assessed with influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG assays. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed in participants who were seronegative at baseline, received both doses of study vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary endpoint, and had no confirmed cases of symptomatic COVID-19 from the first dose until 6 days after the second dose (per-protocol efficacy population). Immunogenicity was assessed in participants who received scheduled two doses of study vaccine, had a baseline sample and at least one post-vaccination sample, and had no major protocol violations before unmasking (per-protocol immunogenicity population). Reactogenicity was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo and had data collected for reactogenicity events. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo.

This report describes the clinical and immunological profile of vaccine breakthrough cases reported in a clinical trial in progress in Chile that is evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two vaccination schedules of CoronaVac (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04651790). Out of the 2,263 fully vaccinated subjects, at end of June 2021, 45 have reported symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 or more days after the second dose (1.99% of fully vaccinated subjects). Of the 45 breakthrough cases, 96% developed mild disease; one case developed a moderate disease; and one developed a severe disease and required mechanical ventilation. Both cases that developed moderate and severe disease were adults over 60 years old and presented comorbidities. The immune response before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection was analyzed in nine vaccine breakthrough cases, revealing that six of them exhibited circulating anti-S1-RBD IgG antibodies with neutralizing capacities after immunization, which showed a significant increase 2 and 4 weeks after symptoms onset. Two cases exhibited low circulating anti-S1-RBD IgG and almost non-existing neutralizing capacity after either vaccination or infection, although they developed a mild disease. An increase in the number of interferon-Î³-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 was detected 2 weeks after the second dose in seven cases and after symptoms onset. In conclusion, breakthrough cases were mostly mild and did not necessarily correlate with a lack of vaccine-induced immunity, suggesting that other factors, to be defined in future studies, could lead to symptomatic infection after vaccination with CoronaVac.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Duarte, GÃ¡lvez, Iturriaga, Melo-GonzÃ¡lez, Soto, Schultz, UrzÃºa, GonzÃ¡lez, VÃ¡zquez, RÃ­os, BerrÃ­os-Rojas, Rivera-PÃ©rez, Moreno-Tapia, Pacheco, Vallejos, Hoppe-Elsholz, Navarrete, Rojas, Fasce, FernÃ¡ndez, Mora, RamÃ­rez, Zeng, Meng, GonzÃ¡lez-Aramundiz, GonzÃ¡lez, Abarca, Bueno and Kalergis.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04651790,Abstract,11/27/2020,1/31/2022,Interventional,"Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Two Vaccination Schedules of an Inactivated Vaccine Against COVID-19 in Adults",Recruiting,Phase 3,Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34659237,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04651790,1,0,1,0,Chile,0,2,SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine,3.398753488900244,1

Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane SÂ glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD 'down', one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4<sup>+</sup> and IFNÎ³<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2Ã— that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement.

Here, we assess a vaccine adjuvant system comprised of immunogenic liposomes that spontaneously convert soluble antigens into a particle format, displayed on the bilayer surface. When trimeric H3 HA was presented on liposomes, antigen delivery to macrophages was improved in vitro, and strong functional antibody responses were induced following intramuscular immunization of mice. Protection was conferred against challenge with a heterologous strain of H3N2 virus, and naive mice were also protected following passive serum transfer. When admixed with the particle-forming liposomes, immunization reduced viral infection severity at vaccine doses as low as 2 ng HA, highlighting dose-sparing potential. In ferrets, immunization induced neutralizing antibodies that reduced the upper respiratory viral load upon challenge with a more modern, heterologous H3N2 viral strain. To demonstrate the flexibility and modular nature of the liposome system, 10 recombinant surface antigens representing distinct influenza virus strains were bound simultaneously to generate a highly multivalent protein particle that with 5 ng individual antigen dosing induced antibodies in mice that specifically recognized the constituent immunogens and conferred protection against heterologous H5N1 influenza virus challenge. Taken together, these results show that stable presentation of recombinant HA on immunogenic liposome surfaces in an arrayed fashion enhances functional immune responses and warrants further attention for the development of broadly protective influenza virus vaccines.</AbstractText>",NCT04783311,Abstract,2/23/2021,3/31/2022,Interventional,"Safety, Tolerance and Immunogenicity of EuCorVac-19 for the Prevention of COVID-19 in Healthy Adults",Recruiting,Phase 1/Phase 2,"EuBiologics Co.,Ltd",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34050027,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04783311,1,0,1,0,"Korea, Republic of",0,1,EuCorVac-19|Normal Saline,3.1050296712655423,1

Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; nâ€‰=â€‰20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; nâ€‰=â€‰32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56â€‰d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; nâ€‰=â€‰10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; nâ€‰=â€‰10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.</AbstractText>",NCT04324606,Abstract,4/23/2020,10/31/2021,Interventional,A Study of a Candidate COVID-19 Vaccine (COV001),"Active, not recruiting",Phase 1/Phase 2,University of Oxford,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33335322,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324606,2,0,2,0,United Kingdom,0,14,ChAdOx1 nCoV-19|MenACWY|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 full boost|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 half boost|MenACWY boost|Paracetamol|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL boost|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL (3.5-6.5x10^10vp) late vaccine (LV)|ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 0.5mL (3.5-6.5x10^10vp) late vaccine two (LVT),3.084389098960995,1

Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population).

The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14â€ˆ703 with the frozen formulation and 11â€ˆ143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49Â·25 with the frozen formulation and 45Â·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2Â·5% CD4<sup>+</sup> and 1Â·3% CD8<sup>+</sup> with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1Â·3% CD4<sup>+</sup> and 1Â·1% CD8<sup>+</sup> with the lyophilised formulation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants.

Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months. Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection). Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN OUTCOMES"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade â‰¥3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RANDOMISATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Eligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups. The IWRS system customizes the randomization algorithm. After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""BLINDING (MASKING)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts. The remaining 11640 subjects will be screened in the Cohort 2 and eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL STATUS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Protocol version 6.0 - 15 October 2020.

Exclusion criteria included (but were not limited to) travel overseas within 14 days of screening, intention to travel overseas within 6 months of the screening visit, and the absence of prespecified medical conditions, including immunosuppressive illness, a history of autoimmune disease, malignancy with risk to recur, a bleeding disorder, uncontrolled HIV infection, uncontrolled hepatitis B and C virus infections, SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 infections, an allergy to any vaccine, or a serious medical condition that could interfere with the study. Study participants were randomly assigned (6:1) to receive two doses of either MVC-COV1901 or placebo, administered via intramuscular injection on day 1 and day 29. MVC-COV1901 contained 15 Î¼g of S-2P protein adjuvanted with 750 Î¼g CpG 1018 and 375 Î¼g aluminium hydroxide in a 0Â·5 mL aqueous solution, and the placebo contained the same volume of saline. Randomisation was done centrally by use of an interactive web response system, stratified by age (â‰¥20 to &lt;65 years and â‰¥65 years). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 from day 1 (the day of the first dose) to day 57 (28 days after the second dose). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring geometric mean titres (GMTs) and seroconversion rates of neutralising antibody and antigen-specific IgG in the per-protocol population.

Vaccine or placebo was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (days 0 and 28). Phase 1 comprised a dose-escalation study, in which participants were allocated to two blocks: block 1 (3 Î¼g inactivated virus in 0Â·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide solution per injection) and block 2 (6 Î¼g per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo (aluminium hydroxide solution only).

In this study, we compared immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine in patients with solid tumors (nâ€‰=â€‰53) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a control cohort of participants without cancer (nâ€‰=â€‰50). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% of patients with cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar patterns were observed for spike protein-specific serum antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. In most patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations. We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997 ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16 participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed in T cell responses. Adverse events were mild. These results suggest that a third dose of BNT162b2 is safe, improves humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and could be immunologically beneficial for patients with cancer on active chemotherapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021.

Despite the considerable disruption the virus has caused to people's lives, many people are still hesitant to receive a vaccine. Without high rates of uptake, however, the pandemic is likely to be prolonged. Here we use two survey experiments to study how persuasive messaging affects COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions. In the first experiment, we test a large number of treatment messages. One subgroup of messages draws on the idea that mass vaccination is a collective action problem and highlighting the prosocial benefit of vaccination or the reputational costs that one might incur if one chooses not to vaccinate. Another subgroup of messages built on contemporary concerns about the pandemic, like issues of restricting personal freedom or economic security. We find that persuasive messaging that invokes prosocial vaccination and social image concerns is effective at increasing intended uptake and also the willingness to persuade others and judgments of non-vaccinators. We replicate this result on a nationally representative sample of Americans and observe that prosocial messaging is robust across subgroups, including those who are most hesitant about vaccines generally. The experiments demonstrate how persuasive messaging can induce individuals to be more likely to vaccinate and also create spillover effects to persuade others to do so as well. The first experiment in this study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov and can be found under the ID number NCT04460703.

The anticipated use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant (LT) recipients is reviewed and practical guidance is provided for health care providers involved in the care of patients with liver disease and LT about vaccine prioritization and administration. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a 94%-95% vaccine efficacy compared to placebo against COVID-19. Local site reactions of pain and tenderness were reported in 70%-90% of clinical trial participants, and systemic reactions of fever and fatigue were reported in 40%-70% of participants, but these reactions were generally mild and self-limited and occurred more frequently in younger persons. Severe hypersensitivity reactions related to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare and more commonly observed in women and persons with a history of previous drug reactions for unclear reasons. Because patients with advanced liver disease and immunosuppressed patients were excluded from the vaccine licensing trials, additional data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are eagerly awaited in these and other subgroups. Remarkably safe and highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are now available for widespread use and should be given to all adult patients with CLD and LT recipients.

Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of infections in general, which in turn translates into increased mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective measure. However, due to impaired immune responses in these patients, the immediate and long-term protective response through immunisation may be incomplete. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the exceptionally fast development of several vaccine candidates. A small number of these SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have already undergone phase III, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in healthy individuals with proof of short-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. However, although regulatory agencies in the US and Europe have already approved some of these vaccines for clinical use, information on immunogenicity, duration of protection and long-term safety in patients with CLD, cirrhosis, hepatobiliary cancer and liver transplant recipients has yet to be generated. This review summarises the data on vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in this patient population in general and discusses the implications of this knowledge on the introduction of the new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 Î¼g or 50 Î¼g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 Î¼g or 50 Î¼g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 Î¼g vaccine (n=20), or the 50 Î¼g vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 32Â·6 (SD 9Â·4) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 Î¼g vaccine (n=150), or 50 Î¼g vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 Î¼g vaccine (n=150), or 50 Î¼g vaccine (n=150).

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on an I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold (hereafter designated RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing-antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an Î±-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist adsorbed to alum; CpG1018-alum, a TLR9 agonist formulated in alum; and alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-alum, AS37 or alum induced substantial neutralizing-antibody and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD-NP in AS03 (RBD-NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD-NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD-NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP-AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion-stabilized spike immunogen (HexaPro) with AS03 adjuvant. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and have led to phase I/II clinical trials of this vaccine (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).</AbstractText>",NCT04742738,Abstract,1/20/2021,7/30/2021,Interventional,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of SARS-CoV-2 Nanoparticle Vaccine (GBP510) Adjuvanted With Aluminum Hydroxide (COVID-19),"Active, not recruiting",Phase 1/Phase 2,"SK Bioscience Co., Ltd.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33873199,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04742738,1,0,1,0,"Korea, Republic of",0,2,GBP510 adjuvanted with Alum (RBD 10Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) - Stage 1|GBP510 adjuvanted with Alum (RBD 25Î¼g/dose) - Stage 1|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) - Stage 1|GBP510 adjuvanted with Alum (RBD 10Î¼g/dose) - Stage 2|GBP510 adjuvanted with Alum (RBD 25Î¼g/dose)- Stage 2|Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution)- Stage 2,2.1906615908703797,1

Participants received two mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 Î¼g in 0Â·5 mL intramuscularly, 28 days apart. The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol (excluding patients with a positive baseline sample [&gt;10 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), was defined as the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG serum antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody concentration of &gt;10 BAU/mL) 28 days after the second vaccination.

However, this view has been radically revised over the past decade and more. Much evidence has now accumulated demonstrating that nitrite serves as a storage form of nitric oxide, releasing nitric oxide preferentially under acidic and/or hypoxic conditions but also occurring under physiologic conditions: a phenomenon that is catalyzed by a number of distinct mammalian nitrite reductases. Importantly, preclinical studies demonstrate that reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide results in a number of beneficial effects, including vasodilatation of blood vessels and lowering of blood pressure, as well as cytoprotective effects that limit the extent of damage caused by an ischemia/reperfusion insult, with this latter issue having been translated more recently to the clinical setting. In addition, research has demonstrated that the other main metabolite of the oxidation of nitric oxide (i.e., nitrate) can also be sequentially reduced through processing in vivo to nitrite and then nitrite to nitric oxide to exert a range of beneficial effects-most notably lowering of blood pressure, a phenomenon that has also been confirmed recently to be an effective method for blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension. This review will provide a detailed description of the pathways involved in the bioactivation of both nitrate and nitrite in vivo, their functional effects in preclinical models, and their mechanisms of action, as well as a discussion of translational exploration of this pathway in diverse disease states characterized by deficiencies in bioavailable nitric oxide. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The past 15 years has seen a major revision in our understanding of the pathways for nitric oxide synthesis in the body with the discovery of the noncanonical pathway for nitric oxide generation known as the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. This review describes the molecular components of this pathway, its role in physiology, potential therapeutics of targeting this pathway, and their impact in experimental models, as well as the clinical translation (past and future) and potential side effects.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 by The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04889274,Registry,5/10/2021,8/1/2021,Interventional,Investigation of the Effects of Dietary Nitrate and Sex on COVID-19 Vaccine Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Healthy Men and Women (DiNOVasc-COVID-19),Recruiting,Phase 1,Queen Mary University of London,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32576603,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889274,0,3,3,0,United Kingdom,0,0,COVID-19 vaccine|Concentrate beetroot Juice|Nitrate-deplete beetroot juice,2.0770404246863112,1

Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment. We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation. A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide. This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide. The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events. Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell and humoral responses. CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide. T-cell avidity toward NY-ESO-1 peptides was higher in patients vaccinated with montanide. In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with poly-ICLC is safe, well tolerated, and capable of inducing integrated antibody and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in most patients. Combination with montanide enhances antigen-specific T-cell avidity and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell cross-priming in a fraction of patients, indicating that montanide contributes to the induction of specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04672291,Registry,7/21/2021,12/31/2022,Interventional,Nasal Poly-ICLC (HiltonolÂ®) in Healthy COVID-19 Vaccinated Adults,Recruiting,Phase 1,"Oncovir, Inc.",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31699709,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04672291,0,34,34,0,Canada,0,6,Poly-ICLC (HiltonolÂ®) or Placebo|Poly-ICLC (HiltonolÂ®) or Placebo,2.0758565434622156,1

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.

This is followed by a slower but targeted and specific response termed the adaptive or acquired immune response. There is emerging evidence that dietary components, including yeast-derived Î²-glucans, can aid host defense against pathogens by modulating inflammatory and antimicrobial activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Innate immune training refers to a newly recognized phenomenon wherein compounds may ""train"" innate immune cells, such that monocyte and macrophage precursor biology is altered to mount a more effective immunological response. Although various human studies have been carried out, much uncertainty still exists and further studies are required to fully elucidate the relationship between Î²-glucan supplementation and human immune function. This review offers an up-to-date report on yeast-derived Î²-glucans as immunomodulators, including a brief overview of the current paradigm regarding the interaction of Î²-glucans with the immune system. The recent pre-clinical work that has partly decrypted mode of action and the newest evidence from human trials are also reviewed. According to pre-clinical studies, Î²-1,3/1,6-glucan derived from baker's yeast may offer increased immuno-surveillance, although the human evidence is weaker than that gained from pre-clinical studies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

There is a growing need to discuss the elements of a coordinated strategy to control the spread and mitigate the severity of COVID-19. H1N1 and <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> vaccines are available. The current analysis was performed to analyze the severity of COVID-19 and influenza (H1N1) vaccination in adults â‰¥ 65. Also, to correlate the lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs), and influenza attributable to the lower respiratory tract infections' incidence with Covid-19 mortality. Evolutionarily influenza is close in resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares some common epitopes and mechanisms. <b>Methods:</b> Recent influenza vaccination data of 34 countries from OECD and other publications were correlated with COVID-19 mortality from worldometer data. LRIs attributable to influenza and streptococcus pneumonia were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, influenza-attributable LRI incidence data of various countries (<i>n</i> = 182) was correlated with COVID-19 death by linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyzes. In a logistic regression model, population density and influenza LRI incidence were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. <b>Results:</b> There is a correlation between COVID-19-related mortality, morbidity, and case incidence and the status of influenza vaccination, which appears protective. The tendency of correlation is increasingly highlighted as the pandemic is evolving. In countries where influenza immunization is less common, there is a correlation between LRIs and influenza attributable to LRI incidence and COVID-19 severity, which is beneficial. ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.86 (CI 0.78 to 0.944, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) to predict COVID-19 mortality &gt;150/million and a decreasing trend of influenza LRI episodes. To predict COVID-19 mortality of &gt;200/million population, the odds ratio for influenza incidence/100,000 was -1.86 (CI -2.75 to -0.96, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). To predict the parameter Covid-19 mortality/influenza LRI episodes<sup>*</sup>1000&gt;1000, the influenza parameter had an odd's ratio of -3.83 (CI -5.98 to -1.67), and an AUC of 0.94. <b>Conclusion:</b> Influenza (H1N1) vaccination can be used as an interim measure to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 in the general population. In appropriate high-risk circumstances, <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> vaccination would also be an adjunct strategy, especially in countries with a lower incidence of LRIs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Arokiaraj.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04798677,Registry,10/29/2020,7/31/2021,Interventional,Efficacy and Tolerability of ABBC1 in Volunteers Receiving the Influenza or Covid-19 Vaccine,Recruiting,Not Applicable,AB Biotek,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33072682,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04798677,0,17,17,0,Spain,0,2,ABBC1 Immunoessential|Placebo,1.5886311985465282,1

BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo.

Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older.

At the same time, development of more immunogenic vaccine alternatives to using aluminium-based adjuvants is one of the most important phases of vaccination development. Among different sources of carbohydrate polymers, including plants, microbes and synthetic sources tested, glucans were found to be the most promising vaccine adjuvant, as they alone stimulate various immune reactions including antibody production without any negative side effects. The use of glucan particles as a delivery system is a viable option based on the documented efficient antigen loading and receptor-targeted uptake in antigen-presenting cells. In addition to particles, soluble glucans can be used as novel hydrogels or as direct immunocyte-targeting delivery systems employing novel complexes with oligodeoxynucleotides. This review focuses on recent advances in glucan-based vaccine development from glucan-based conjugates to a glucan-based delivery and adjuvant platform.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2019 The Scandinavian Foundation for Immunology.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04798677,Registry,10/29/2020,7/31/2021,Interventional,Efficacy and Tolerability of ABBC1 in Volunteers Receiving the Influenza or Covid-19 Vaccine,Recruiting,Not Applicable,AB Biotek,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31544248,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04798677,0,17,17,0,Spain,0,2,ABBC1 Immunoessential|Placebo,1.5629683358882644,1
