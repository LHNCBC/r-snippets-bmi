In areas of pandemic outbreak, the number of patients can exceed maximum capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), and, thus, these individuals often receive non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU. Effective treatments for this population are needed urgently. Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that might be beneficial in this patient population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy. We included consecutive patients (aged â‰¥18 years) with COVID-19, moderate-to-severe ARDS, and hyperinflammation (defined as serum C-reactive protein â‰¥100 mg/L, ferritin â‰¥900 ng/mL, or both) who were managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU and who received standard treatment of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine twice a day orally and 400 mg lopinavir with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day orally. We compared survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, changes in C-reactive protein, respiratory function, and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with anakinra (either 5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously [high dose] or 100 mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at 21 days.

A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status. At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died. In the standard treatment group, eight (50%) of 16 patients showed respiratory improvement at 21 days; one (6%) patient was on mechanical ventilation and seven (44%) died. At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0Â·009). Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0Â·15).

We developed a predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on lung ultrasound and clinical features. We used ultrasound to image the lung bilaterally at two anterior sites, one and two hands below each clavicle, and a posterolateral site that was the posterior transverse continuation from the lower anterior site. We studied 100 patients, 31 of whom had a COVID-19 positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A positive test was independently associated with: quick sequential organ failure assessment score â‰¥1; â‰¥3 B-lines at the upper site; consolidation and thickened pleura at the lower site; and thickened pleura line at the posterolateral site. The model discrimination was an area (95%CI) under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (0.75-0.90). The characteristics (95%CI) of the model's diagnostic threshold, applied to the population from which it was derived, were: sensitivity, 97% (83-100%); specificity, 62% (50-74%); positive predictive value, 54% (41-98%); and negative predictive value, 98% (88-99%).

Prone positioning in intubated patients is known to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18-75 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO<sub>2</sub>]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment.

Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (83Â·9% [95% CI 71Â·7 to 92Â·4]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio 180Â·5 mm Hg [SD 76Â·6] in supine position vs 285Â·5 mm Hg [112Â·9] in prone position; p&lt;0Â·0001).

The effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting to the hospital with surgical complaints remain uncertain. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A single tertiary center retrospective study analysis compared the ED attendance rate and severity of patients with surgical complaints between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2019 and 2018. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall, 6,017 patients were included. The mean daily ED visits of patients with nontrauma surgical complaints in the COVID-19 outbreak period declined by 27%-32% (<i>P</i> value &lt;.01) compared with pre-COVID-19 periods. The log number of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Israel in March 2020 was negatively correlated with the number of ED visits (Pearson's <i>r</i>â€‰=â€‰-0.59, <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01). The proportion of patients requiring hospitalization increased by up to 8% during the outbreak period (<i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01), and there was a higher proportion of tachycardic patients (20% versus 15.5%, <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰.01). The percentage of visits to the ED by men declined by 5% (<i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01).

The associations between symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and NPS results were calculated as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs by multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education, smoking habits, and number of comorbidities. Thereafter, for each symptom and for combinations of the symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and areas under the curve (AUCs) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the occurrence of COVID-19-like infection in the nontested population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 171,310 people responded to the survey, of whom 102,543 (59.9%) were women; mean age 47.4 years. Out of the 4785 respondents with known NPS test results, 4392 were not hospitalized. Among the 4392 nonhospitalized respondents, those with positive NPS tests (856, 19.5%) most frequently reported myalgia (527, 61.6%), olfactory and taste disorders (507, 59.2%), cough (466, 54.4%), and fever (444, 51.9%), whereas 7.7% were asymptomatic. Multiple regression analysis showed that olfactory and taste disorders (aOR 10.3, 95% CI 8.4-12.7), fever (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.1), myalgia (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and cough (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with NPS positivity. Having two to four of these symptoms increased the aOR from 7.4 (95% CI 5.6-9.7) to 35.5 (95% CI 24.6-52.2). The combination of the four symptoms showed an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI 0.795-0.825) in classifying positive NPS test results and then was applied to the nonhospitalized and nontested sample (n=165,782).

32809969,"<AbstractText>BACKGROUNDPatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop pneumonia generally associated with lymphopenia and a severe inflammatory response due to uncontrolled cytokine release. These mediators are transcriptionally regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules.METHODSWe treated a group of patients (n = 20) with baricitinib according to an off-label use of the drug. The study was designed as an observational, longitudinal trial and approved by the local ethics committee. The patients were treated with 4 mg baricitinib twice daily for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for the remaining 7 days. Changes in the immune phenotype and expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in blood cells were evaluated and correlated with serum-derived cytokine levels and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2). In a single treated patient, we also evaluated the alteration of myeloid cell functional activity.RESULTSWe provide evidence that patients treated with baricitinib had a marked reduction in serum levels of IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î±, a rapid recovery of circulating T and B cell frequencies, and increased antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, all of which were clinically associated with a reduction in the need for oxygen therapy and a progressive increase in the P/F (PaO2, oxygen partial pressure/FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio.CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that baricitinib prevented the progression to a severe, extreme form of the viral disease by modulating the patients' immune landscape and that these changes were associated with a safer, more favorable clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04438629.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Fondazione Cariverona (ENACT Project) and the Fondazione TIM.</AbstractText>",Baricitinib restrains the immune dysregulation in patients with severe COVID-19.,Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Multicenter Study|Observational Study,Azetidines|Cytokines|Purines|Pyrazoles|Sulfonamides|baricitinib|NA,"Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Azetidines|B-Lymphocytes|COVID-19|Cytokines|Female|Humans|Longitudinal Studies|Male|Middle Aged|Off-Label Use|Purines|Pyrazoles|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index|Sulfonamides|T-Lymphocytes|NA",2020-12-14,The Journal of clinical investigation,NCT04438629,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32809969,NA
32829467,"<AbstractText>We report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response associated with a fatal case of COVID-19 in Europe. This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3-fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in Î³Î´ T cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.

32915072,"<AbstractText><b>Rationale:</b> Patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have complex organ support needs that necessitate prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), likely to result in a high incidence of neuromuscular weakness and loss of well-being. Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations.<b>Objectives:</b> To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation, and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19.<b>Methods:</b> Adults admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for &gt;24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score to identify the time taken to first mobilize (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge.<b>Results:</b> A total of <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰177 patients were identified, of whom <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. While on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19â€‰Â±â€‰10 d), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard deviation time to first mobilize was 14â€‰Â±â€‰7 days, with a median Manchester Mobility Score at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4-6), which represents participants able to stand and step around to a chair with or without assistance.

This project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04367129). Standard ECG was recorded at hospital admission. ECG was abnormal in 93% of the patients. Atrial fibrillation/flutter was detected in 22% of the patients. ECG signs suggesting acute right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) were detected in 30% of the patients. In particular, 43 (10%) patients had the S1Q3T3 pattern, 38 (9%) had incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and 49 (11%) had complete RBBB. ECG signs of acute RVPO were not statistically different between patients with (n = 104) or without (n=327) invasive mechanical ventilation during ECG recording (36% vs. 28%, P = 0.10). Non-specific repolarization abnormalities and low QRS voltage in peripheral leads were present in 176 (41%) and 23 (5%), respectively. In four patients showing ST-segment elevation, acute myocardial infarction was confirmed with coronary angiography. No ST-T abnormalities suggestive of acute myocarditis were detected. In the subgroup of 110 patients where high-sensitivity troponin I was available, ECG features were not statistically different when stratified for above or below the 5 times upper reference limit value.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The ECG is abnormal in almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients and shows a large spectrum of abnormalities, with signs of acute RVPO in 30% of the patients.

32972320,"<AbstractText>Background Recent literature reports a strong thrombotic tendency in patients hospitalized for a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID-19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID-19 infections. Methods and Results In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D-dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. Conclusions We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID-19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID-19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

32991329,"<AbstractText>BACKGROUNDSerological assays are of critical importance to investigate correlates of response and protection in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to define previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in populations, and to verify the development of an adaptive immune response in infected individuals.METHODSWe studied 509 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan and 480 samples of prepandemic organ donor sera collected in 2010-2012. Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronaviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.TRIAL REGISTRATIONCOVID-19 Patients Characterization, Biobank, Treatment Response and Outcome Predictor (COVID-BioB).

Mean age was 39.4 years (SD Â± 12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19-related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738).

33089824,"<AbstractText>Infectious pathogens are a global issue. Global air travel offers an easy and fast opportunity not only for people but also for infectious diseases to spread around the world within a few days. Also, large public events facilitate increasing infection numbers. Therefore, rapid on-site screening for infected people is urgently needed. Due to the small size and easy handling, ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is a very promising, sensitive method for the on-site identification of infectious pathogens based on scents, representing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether identification of Influenza-A-infection based on VOCs by MCC-IMS is possible in breath. Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive persons with and without Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Four healthy staff members and six patients with negative PCR result served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from those not infected with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept-study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 min by MCC-IMS. The next step is to validate the results with a greater number of patients with Influenza-A-infection as well as other viral diseases, especially COVID-19.

This cross-sectional study evaluated relationships of loneliness with depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and drug use during COVID-19, and assessed perceived increases in these symptoms in young adults. Between April 22 and May 11, 2020, 1,008 participants ages 18-35 were recruited through social media to a one-time, online anonymous survey. Symptomatology was assessed using six scales.

Forty-nine percent of respondents reported loneliness scores above 50; 80% reported significant depressive symptoms; 61% reported moderate to severe anxiety; 30% disclosed harmful levels of drinking. While only 22% of the population reported using drugs, 38% reported severe drug use. Loneliness was associated with higher levels of mental health symptomatology. Participants reported significant increases across mental health and substance use symptoms since COVID-19. While direct impacts of COVID-19 could only be calculated with pre-pandemic assessments of these symptoms, estimates indicate elevated psychosocial symptomatology and suggest that symptoms could have worsened since the pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of prevention and intervention to address these public health problems.</AbstractText>","Loneliness, Mental Health, and Substance Use among US Young Adults during COVID-19.","Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", ,Adolescent|Adult|Age Factors|Alcoholism|Anxiety|COVID-19|Cross-Sectional Studies|Depression|Female|Health Status|Humans|Loneliness|Male|Mental Health|Pandemics|Psychiatric Status Rating Scales|Sex Factors|Substance-Related Disorders|Surveys and Questionnaires|United States|Young Adult|NA,2021-03-11,Journal of psychoactive drugs,NCT04440098,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33111650,NA

We therefore sought to study the relationship between COVID-19, AKI, and outcomes in a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to 2 acute hospitals in Derby, United Kingdom.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND FINDINGS"">We extracted electronic data from 4,759 hospitalised patients who were tested for COVID-19 between 5 March 2020 and 12 May 2020. The data were linked to electronic patient records and laboratory information management systems. The primary outcome was AKI, and secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, need for ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of stay. As compared to the COVID-19-negative group (n = 3,374), COVID-19 patients (n = 1,161) were older (72.1 Â± 16.1 versus 65.3 Â± 20.4 years, p &lt; 0.001), had a greater proportion of men (56.6% versus 44.9%, p &lt; 0.001), greater proportion of Asian ethnicity (8.3% versus 4.0%, p &lt; 0.001), and lower proportion of white ethnicity (75.5% versus 82.5%, p &lt; 0.001). AKI developed in 304 (26.2%) COVID-19-positive patients (COVID-19 AKI) and 420 (12.4%) COVID-19-negative patients (AKI controls). COVID-19 patients aged 65 to 84 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.50), needing mechanical ventilation (OR 8.74, 95% CI 5.27 to 14.77), having congestive cardiac failure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.50), chronic liver disease (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.00), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.97 to 4.01) had higher odds for developing AKI. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 AKI versus COVID-19 patients without AKI (60.5% versus 27.4%, p &lt; 0.001), and AKI was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.39 to 4.48). Compared with AKI controls, COVID-19 AKI was observed in a higher proportion of men (58.9% versus 51%, p = 0.04) and lower proportion with white ethnicity (74.7% versus 86.9%, p = 0.003); was more frequently associated with cerebrovascular disease (11.8% versus 6.0%, p = 0.006), chronic lung disease (28.0% versus 19.3%, p = 0.007), diabetes (24.7% versus 17.9%, p = 0.03), and CKD (34.2% versus 20.0%, p &lt; 0.001); and was more likely to be hospital acquired (61.2% versus 46.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Mortality was higher in the COVID-19 AKI as compared to the control AKI group (60.5% versus 27.6%, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AKI patients aged 65 to 84 years, (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.35) and â‰¥85 years of age (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.87 to 6.70), peak AKI stage 2 (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.90), AKI stage 3 (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.57), and COVID-19 (OR 3.80, 95% CI 2.62 to 5.51) had higher odds of death. Limitations of the study include retrospective design, lack of urinalysis data, and low ethnic diversity of the region.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We observed a high incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 that was associated with a 3-fold higher odds of death than COVID-19 without AKI and a 4-fold higher odds of death than AKI due to other causes.

Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive.

Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study.

Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28.

A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among the healthcare workforce in the most populous cities from three Latin American countries in April 2020. In total, 1,082 participants were included. Of these, 534 (49.4%), 263 (24.3%), and 114 (10.5%) were physicians, nurses, and other professionals, respectively. At least 70% of participants reported a lack of PPE. The most common shortages were shortages in gown coverall suits (643, 59.4%), N95 masks (600, 55.5%), and face shields (569, 52.6%). Professionals who performed procedures that generated aerosols reported shortages more frequently (p&lt;0.05). Professionals working in the emergency department and primary care units reported more shortages than those working in intensive care units and hospital-based wards (p&lt;0.001). Up to 556 (51.4%) participants reported the lack of sufficient knowledge about using PPE.

WhatsApp and similar apps are also widely used to facilitate clinical communication between physicians. Moreover, WhatsApp is used by emergency department (ED) physicians and consulting physicians to exchange medical information during ED consultations. This platform is regarded as a useful app in the consultation of dermatological and orthopedic cases. Preventing overcrowding in the ED is key to reducing the risk of disease transmission, and teleconsulting practice is thought to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission risk of disease, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video consultation is highly recommended in some countries on the grounds that it is likely to reduce the risk of transmission. WhatsApp-like apps are among the video consultation platforms that are assumed to reduce the risk of contamination by minimizing patient-physician contact.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of WhatsApp video consultation on patient admission and discharge times in comparison to bedside consultation in the evaluation of potential patients with COVID-19 visiting a COVID-19 outpatient clinic during the pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Patients who presented to the ED COVID-19 outpatient clinic between March 11 and May 31, 2020, and for whom an infectious disease specialist was consulted (via WhatsApp or at bedside) were included in the study in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P&lt;.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04645563; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04645563.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Ramazan SabÄ±rlÄ±, Emre Karsli, Omer Canacik, Dogan Ercin, Handan Ã‡iftÃ§i, Levent Sahin, Turgut Dolanbay, Emin Ediz Tutuncu.

Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">This study has core institution approval (UBC Providence Healthcare Research Ethics Board) and site institution approvals (Health Research Ethics Board, University of Alberta; Comite d'etique de la recerche, CHU Sainte Justine (for McGill University and University of Sherbrook); Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, University of Calgary; Queen's University Health Sciences &amp; Affiliated Hospitals Research Ethics Board; Research Ethics Board, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; Veritas Independent Research Board (for Humber River Hospital); Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board; Unity Health Toronto Research Ethics Board, St. Michael's Hospital).

No data have been reported on the impact of diabetes on treatment and outcome of STEMI patients, that was therefore the aim of the current subanalysis conducted in patients included in the International Study on Acute Coronary Syndromes-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ISACS-STEMI) COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 is a retrospective registry performed in European centers with an annual volume ofâ€‰&gt;â€‰120 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and assessed STEMI patients, treated with primary PCI during the same periods of the years 2019 versus 2020 (March and April). Main outcomes are the incidences of primary PCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 6609 patients underwent primary PCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. Diabetes was observed in a total of 1356 patients (20.5%), with similar proportion between 2019 and 2020. During the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in primary PCI as compared to 2019, similar in both patients with (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) and without diabetes (IRR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) (p intâ€‰=â€‰0.40). We observed a significant heterogeneity among centers in the population with and without diabetes (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001, respectively). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19 in both groups of patients. Interaction was observed for Hypertension (pâ€‰=â€‰0.024) only in absence of diabetes. Furthermore, the pandemic was independently associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times only among patients without diabetes, which may have contributed to the higher mortality, during the pandemic, observed in this group of patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The COVID-19 pandemic had aÂ significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a similar reduction in primary PCI procedures in both patients with and without diabetes.

This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04492904; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04492904.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/24797.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Florence Sheen, Vicki Tan, Sumanto Haldar, Sharmila Sengupta, David Allen, Jyoti Somani, Hui Yee Chen, Paul Tambyah, Ciaran G Forde.

Its high infection rate and rapid spread contribute to set the risk for relevant psychological stress in citizens. In this context, mother-infant health is at risk not only because of potential direct exposure to the virus but also due to high levels of stress experienced by mothers from conception to delivery. Prenatal stress exposure associates with less-than-optimal child developmental outcomes, and specific epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA methylation) may play a critical role in mediating this programming association.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">We present the methodological protocol for a longitudinal, multicentric study on the behavioural and epigenetic effects of COVID-19-related prenatal stress in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Northern Italy. The dyads will be enrolled at 10 facilities in Northern Italy. Saliva samples will be collected at birth to assess the methylation status of specific genes linked with stress regulation in mothers and newborns. Mothers will provide retrospective data on COVID-19-related stress during pregnancy. At 3, 6 and 12 months, mothers will provide data on child behavioural and socioemotional outcomes, their own psychological status (stress, depressive and anxious symptoms) and coping strategies. At 12 months, infants and mothers will be videotaped during semistructured interaction to assess maternal sensitivity and infant's relational functioning.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Pavia).

Healthcare professionals are heavily affected by this rapidly changing situation, especially frontline healthcare professionals who are directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 and may experience psychological burdens. The objective of this study is to explore the evolution of psychosocial, cardiovascular, and immune markers in healthcare professionals with different levels of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods and Analysis:</b> This is a STROBE compliant, blended, exploratory study involving online and onsite approaches that use wearable monitoring. A planned random probability sample of residents, staff physicians, nurses, and auxiliary healthcare professionals will be recruited. The study sample will be stratified by exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a first step, recruitment will be conducted online, with e-consent and using e-surveys with Maslach Burnout Inventory, Fuster-BEWAT score, and sociodemographic characteristics. Onsite visits will be planned for the second step where participants will receive a wearable setup that will measure heart rate, actimetry, and sleep quality monitoring, which will be used together with blood sampling for immune biomarkers. Steps 1 and 2 will then be repeated at 2-3 months, and 6 months.

Although most children appear to have mild or asymptomatic infections, infants and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of experiencing more severe illness and requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The recent but uncommon association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has heightened the importance of understanding paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">The Paediatric Emergency Research Network-COVID-19 cohort study is a rapid, global, prospective cohort study enrolling 12â€‰500 children who are tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 47 emergency departments across 12 countries on four continents will participate. At enrolment, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results, all children will have the same information collected, including clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, imaging and outcome data. Interventions and outcome data will be collected for hospitalised children. For all children, follow-up at 14 and 90 days will collect information on further medical care received, and long-term sequelae, respectively. Statistical models will be designed to identify risk factors for infection and severe outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">Sites will seek ethical approval locally, and informed consent will be obtained. There is no direct risk or benefit of study participation. Weekly interim analysis will allow for real-time data sharing with regional, national, and international policy makers. Harmonisation and sharing of investigation materials with WHO, will contribute to synergising global efforts for the clinical characterisation of paediatric COVID-19. Our findings will enable the implementation of countermeasures to reduce viral transmission and severe COVID-19 outcomes in children.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER"">NCT04330261.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Identification of COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who might develop into severe or critical illness is essential to save lives. We conducted an observational study in a dedicated make-shift hospital for adult male COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms between February and March 2020. Baseline characteristics, medical history, and clinical presentation were recorded. Laboratory tests and chest computed tomography were performed. Patients were observed until they were either transferred to a hospital for advanced care owing to disease exacerbation or were discharged after improvement. Patients were grouped based on their chest imaging findings or short-term outcomes. A total of 125 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled. Of these, 7 patients were transferred for advanced care while 118 patients were discharged after improvement and showed no disease recurrence during an additional 28-day follow-up period. Eighty-five patients (68.0%) had abnormal chest imaging findings. Patients with abnormal chest imaging findings were more likely to have disease deterioration and require advanced care as compared to those with normal chest imaging findings. Patients with deteriorated outcomes were more likely to have low peripheral blood oxygen saturation and moderately-elevated body temperature. There were no significant differences between patients with deteriorated or improved outcomes with respect to age, comorbidities, or other clinical symptoms (including nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea). Abnormal chest imaging findings, low peripheral blood oxygen saturation, and elevated temperature were associated with disease deterioration in adult male COVID-19 patients with mild clinical symptoms. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/SelectProtocol?sid=S0009RA3&amp;selectaction=Edit&amp;uid=U0003F4L&amp;ts=2&amp;cx=-ajpsbw, identifier NCT04346602.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Yan, Song, Guo, Wang, Peng and Li.</CopyrightInformation>",Association Between Clinical Characteristics and Short-Term Outcomes in Adult Male COVID-19 Patients With Mild Clinical Symptoms: A Single-Center Observational Study.,Journal Article, , ,2021-01-22,Frontiers in medicine,NCT04346602,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469542,NA

33528568,"<AbstractText>Profound T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL) dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older COVID-19 patients, we hypothesize, are, therefore, at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting (SB) of the terminal restriction fragments in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87 Â± 8 (mean Â± SD) and 87 Â± 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields 2 key metrics: the proportions of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %) and their mean (TeSLA mTL), (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 Â± 0.42 in COVID-19 patients and 1.50 Â± 0.50 in non-COVID-19 patients (p &lt; .001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (p = .005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (p = .03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to COVID-19 lymphopenia among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.

To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954 ). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

33596668,"<AbstractText>Background COVID-19 may present with a variety of cardiovascular manifestations, and elevations of biomarkers reflecting myocardial injury and stress are prevalent. SARS-CoV-2 has been found in cardiac tissue, and myocardial dysfunction post-COVID-19 may occur. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and cardiovascular biomarkers remains unknown. Methods and Results COVID MECH (COVID-19 Mechanisms) was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 patients (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60Â±15Â (mean Â± SD) years, 71 (58%) were men, 68 (55%) were White, and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently men, had more diabetes mellitus, and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin (all &lt;0.001), but comparable levels of cTnT (cardiac troponin T; <i>P</i>=0.09), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; <i>P</i>=0.27) and D-dimer (<i>P</i>=0.67) to patients without viremia. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in plasma at either baseline or day 3 in 50 (52%) patients, and these patients experienced increase from baseline to day 3 in NT-proBNP and D-dimer concentrations, while there was no change in cTnT. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 viremia was associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory, but not cardiovascular biomarkers. NT-proBNP and D-dimer, but not cTnT, increased from baseline to day 3 in patients with viremia.

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, associations of these mental health and behavioral factors with work-related factors and support will be explored. Six-weeks and 4-months follow-up: Follow-up questionnaires will assess change in symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, use of alcohol and other substances, behavioral or interpersonal relationship changes. Physical wellbeing will be assessed through the presence of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and absence from work. We will also evaluate the impact of variable provision of personal protection equipment (supply and training), extended working hours, and concern for the wellbeing of family members, anxiety levels, and evidence of burnout.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Statistical Considerations"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The study has 80% power to detect a 10% difference of combined depression and/or anxiety symptoms between the groups using two-sided type 1 error at 0.05 at baseline.

33625799,"<AbstractText>A decreased lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub> ) has been reported in a variable proportion of subjects over the first 3Â months of recovery from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we investigated whether measurement of lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide (DL<sub>NO</sub> ) offers additional insights on the presence and mechanisms of gas transport abnormalities. In 94 subjects, recovering from mild-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, we measured DL<sub>NO</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub> between 10 and 266Â days after each patient was tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In 38 subjects, a chest computed tomography (CT) was available for semiquantitative analysis at six axial levels and automatic quantitative analysis of entire lungs. DL<sub>NO</sub> was abnormal in 57% of subjects, independent of time of lung function testing and severity of COVID-19, whereas standard DL<sub>CO</sub> was reduced in only 20% and mostly within the first 3Â months. These differences were not associated with changes of simultaneous DL<sub>NO</sub> /DL<sub>CO</sub> ratio, while DL<sub>CO</sub> /V<sub>A</sub> and DL<sub>NO</sub> /V<sub>A</sub> were within normal range or slightly decreased. DL<sub>CO</sub> but not DL<sub>NO</sub> positively correlated with recovery time and DL<sub>CO</sub> was within the normal range in about 90% of cases after 3Â months, while DL<sub>NO</sub> was reduced in more than half of subjects. Both DL<sub>NO</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub> inversely correlated with persisting CT ground glass opacities and mean lung attenuation, but these were more frequently associated with DL<sub>NO</sub> than DL<sub>CO</sub> decrease. These data show that an impairment of DL<sub>NO</sub> exceeding standard DL<sub>CO</sub> may be present during the recovery from COVID-19, possibly due to loss of alveolar units with alveolar membrane damage, but relatively preserved capillary volume. Alterations of gas transport may be present even in subjects who had mild COVID-19 pneumonia and no or minimal persisting CT abnormalities.

Shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment. Helmet is an effective interface to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) noninvasively. We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations (DNI).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy (i.e., non-rebreathing mask) due to COVID-19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system. Patients' data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter. CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or death.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 306 patients were included; 42% were deemed as DNI. Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69% of the full treatment and 28% of the DNI patients (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). With helmet CPAP, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio doubled from about 100 to 200Â mmHg (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001); respiratory rate decreased from 28 [22-32] to 24 [20-29] breaths per minute, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). C-reactive protein, time to oxygen mask failure, age, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> during CPAP, number of comorbidities were independently associated with CPAP failure. Helmet CPAP was maintained for 6 [3-9] days, almost continuously during the first two days. None of the full treatment patients died before intubation in the wards.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Helmet CPAP treatment is feasible for several days outside the ICU, despite persistent impairment in gas exchange. It was used, without escalating to intubation, in the majority of full treatment patients after standard oxygen therapy failed.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 among United States (US) dental hygienists, describe infection prevention and control procedures and any associated trends in mental health.<b>Methods:</b> Registered dental hygienists (RDHs) licensed in the US were invited to participate in a 30-question web-based survey. COVID-19 infection items included probable and confirmed results, COVID-19 related symptoms experienced in the last month, and level of concern about COVID-19 transmission to patients and themselves. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire 4 screened respondents for depression or anxiety. Personal protective equipment (PPE) use when treating patients was assessed. The research protocol and survey were approved by the American Dental Association IRB and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04542915).

We invited all employees (nâ€‰=â€‰15,300) at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden to participate in a study examining SARS-Cov-2 antibodies in relation to registered sick leave. For consenting 12,928 healthy hospital employees antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could be determined and compared to participant sick leave records. Subjects with viral serum antibodies were not at excess risk for future sick leave (adjusted odds ratio (OR) controlling for age and sex: 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.85 (0.43-1.68)]. By contrast, subjects with antibodies had an excess risk for sick leave in the weeks prior to testing [adjusted OR in multivariate analysis: 3.34 (2.98-3.74)]. Thus, presence of viral antibodies marks past disease and protection against excess risk of future disease.

In multivariate analysis, current smokers had almost half the odds of a positive NPS test result (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to nonsmokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate smokers (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), and heavy smokers (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53). This inverse association also persisted when considering the severity of the infection. Current smokers had a statistically significantly lower probability of having asymptomatic (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), mild (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.81), and severe infections (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) compared to those who never smoked.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Current smoking was negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-dependent relationship.

Determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by rRT-PCR sometimes results in an inconclusive test result due to a high cycle threshold-value. We retrospectively analyzed 30,851 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test results. Borderline positivity was considered as the presence of â‰¤25 viral copies per milliliter, while no amplification was considered as a negative test result. Of all test results, 204 were answered as borderline, of which 107 were accompanied by a follow-up test within 96 hours. Of the 107 follow-up samples, 10 (9.35%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 symptoms were not predictive for testing positive in the follow-up test.

Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes.

33740028,"<AbstractText>The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel, Switzerland was detected on February 26th 2020. We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83Â·6%), detected first on March 2nd, although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 68Â·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T ('Basel cluster'), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the 'Basel cluster', some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data, allows connection and interpretation of events, and can inform public health interventions.

An association between anxiety and increased body weight has been documented. Identifying associations between diet quality and anxiety may facilitate the development of preventive dietary policy, particularly relevant since obesity appears to increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In this study we aim to examine associations between changes in diet pattern and body weight and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among Israeli respondents to an international online survey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Conducted between March 30-April 252,020, this was cross-sectional, international and online study. The questionnaire was developed and tested in Hebrew and translated into six other languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian. The survey was conducted on a Google Survey platform, the link to which was posted on several social media platforms. Adults aged 18 or older who saw and responded to the link on a social media site comprised the study population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of the 3979 eligible respondents, 1895 indicated their current location as Israel. Most Israeli respondents completed the survey in Hebrew (83.2%) followed by Arabic (9.4%), though responses were recorded in all seven of the survey languages. The median age was 33 (IQâ€‰=â€‰22) years, and 75.7% were female. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet, and 25.2% indicated they had gained weight during the pandemic. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQâ€‰=â€‰3). While the median General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score was 5 (IQâ€‰=â€‰8), only 37.3% of participants reported at least mild anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 5 or more), while 10.7% reported moderate anxiety or greater (a GAD-7 score of 10 or more). In a multivariate logistic regression model of at least mild anxiety, being male and completing the survey in Hebrew significantly reduced odds of at least mild anxiety, while a worsening of diet quality during the pandemic, weight gain, and isolation significantly increased odds of at least mild anxiety.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">During the COVID pandemic, changes in nutrition quality and habits were associated with greater anxiety. These findings suggest the need for routine and continuous surveillance of the nutritional and psychological consequences of outbreaks as part of healthcare preparedness efforts. Organizations responsible for community-based health services (such as Israeli health plans) should adopt specific interventions to improve case finding and support individuals at increased risk of anxiety and declining nutrition status within primary healthcare settings. These interventions should include the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers. Primary care physicians should refer people with high anxiety or substantial weight gain during the pandemic to appropriate mental health and dietetic treatment, as needed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">NCT04353934 .</AbstractText>",Multinational dietary changes and anxiety during the coronavirus pandemic-findings from Israel.,Journal Article, ,Adult|Anxiety|COVID-19|Cross-Sectional Studies|Diet|Female|Global Health|Health Behavior|Health Status|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Socioeconomic Factors|NA,2021-04-02,Israel journal of health policy research,NCT04353934,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33757598,NA

All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss.

33796490,"<AbstractText><b>Background:</b> Switzerland had one of the highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Europe during the second wave. Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes. <b>Methods:</b> Fourteen out of the randomly selected sample of the <i>Ciao Corona</i> cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days. <b>Results:</b> Out of 1,299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least one of two testings. None of the teachers but one child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 h to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. Thirty-five percent of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing. <b>Conclusion:</b> In a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Kriemler, Ulyte, Ammann, Peralta, Berger, Puhan and Radtke.</CopyrightInformation>",Surveillance of Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infections in School Children and Point-Prevalence During a Time of High Community Transmission in Switzerland.,Journal Article, , ,2021-04-03,Frontiers in pediatrics,NCT04448717,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33796490,NA

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P &lt; .001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination.

The main comorbidities were diabetes (nÂ =Â 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (nÂ =Â 401, 35%), and obesity (nÂ =Â 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30Â days of diagnosis. We found no association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality (unadjusted HRÂ =Â 1.13, 95% CI [0.8-1.6]; propensity inverse probability treatment weighted HRÂ =Â 1.09 [0.86-1.39]; propensity standardized mortality ratio weighted HRÂ =Â 1.08 [0.79-1.47]). Our comprehensive review of previous studies highlighted that significant associations were mostly found in unrestricted populations with inappropriate adjustment, or with biased in-hospital exposure measurement.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results do not support previous concerns regarding these drugs, nor a potential protective effect as reported in previous poorly designed studies and meta-analyses.

We found a six-factor solution stemming from our EFAs to best fit our data.

Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are considered an important addition to molecular tests in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly because of their fast turnaround time, easier analytical procedure and lower price. However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

34031519,"<AbstractText>COVID-19 pneumonia has specific features and outcomes that suggests a unique immunopathogenesis. Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets. Further investigations are required to define the role of NEFAs in the pathogenesis and the dysregulated immune response associated with COVID-19.Trial registration: NCT04435223.</AbstractText>",High plasma concentration of non-esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids is a specific feature of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Apolipoproteins E|Arachidonic Acids|Cholesterol, HDL|Cytokines|Fatty Acids, Nonesterified|Linoleic Acids|NA","Aged|Apolipoproteins E|Arachidonic Acids|COVID-19|Cholesterol, HDL|Cytokines|Fatty Acids, Nonesterified|Female|Humans|Linoleic Acids|Male|Middle Aged|Principal Component Analysis|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index|NA",2021-06-02,Scientific reports,NCT04435223,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34031519,NA

So, we aimed to detect the percentage, type, and risk factors of persistent symptoms after improvement from acute COVID-19 infection and to detect the percentage of COVID-19 re-infection and degree of severity of the second infection. One hundred seventy-two (59 male, 113 female) patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were followed up via mobile phone every 2 months for 8 to 10 months. After recovery, 105 patients (61%) (30 male, 75 female) reported one or more COVID-19 persistent symptoms. Fatigue, dyspnea, and depression were the most common persistent symptoms representing 37.3%, 22%, 22%, respectively. We found that age was independently related to the persistence of symptoms. During the follow-up, six females (3.5%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 re-infection. Their mean age was 35.7â€‰Â±â€‰11 years. The mean interval from the complete recovery of the first infection to the onset of the second one was 53â€‰Â±â€‰22.2 days and ranged from 30 to 90 days.

34184935,"<AbstractText>Background There are conflicting data regarding the diagnostic performance of chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia. Disease extent at CT has been reported to influence prognosis. Purpose To create a large publicly available data set and assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods This multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study involved 20 French university hospitals. Eligible patients presented at the emergency departments of the hospitals involved between March 1 and April 30th, 2020, and underwent both thoracic CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images were read blinded to initial reports, RT-PCR, demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and outcome. Readers classified CT scans as either positive or negative for COVID-19 based on criteria published by the French Society of Radiology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a model predicting severe outcome (intubation or death) at 1-month follow-up in patients positive for both RT-PCR and CT, using clinical and radiologic features. Results Among 10â€‰930 patients screened for eligibility, 10â€‰735 (median age, 65 years; interquartile range, 51-77 years; 6147 men) were included and 6448 (60%) had a positive RT-PCR result. With RT-PCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 80.2% (95% CI: 79.3, 81.2) and 79.7% (95% CI: 78.5, 80.9), respectively, with strong agreement between junior and senior radiologists (Gwet AC1 coefficient, 0.79). Of all the variables analyzed, the extent of pneumonia at CT (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI: 2.71, 3.89) was the best predictor of severe outcome at 1 month. A score based solely on clinical variables predicted a severe outcome with an area under the curve of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.66), improving to 0.69 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.71) when it also included the extent of pneumonia and coronary calcium score at CT. Conclusion Using predefined criteria, CT reading is not influenced by reader's experience and helps predict the outcome at 1 month.

High-altitude environment and COVID-19: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in the highest city in the world. <i>High Alt Med Biol.</i> 22: 000-000, 2021. <b><i>Background:</i></b> A reduced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diffusion has been suggested in high-altitude areas but remained questionable. Aims of this study were to estimate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity as well as the risk factors associated in La Rinconada, the highest city in the world (5,100-5,300â€‰m), a gold-mining town located in southeastern Peru where &gt;50,000 dwellers live in precarious sanitary conditions. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We performed a cross-sectional study during a 1-week period in October 2020, using point-of-care lateral flow serological assays allowing detection of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary dwellers in La Rinconada. Participants were also questioned about potential occupational and environmental risk factors of COVID-19 occurrence. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In a sample of 159 dwellers tested in La Rinconada, 48.4% [95% confidence interval, CI: 40.5-56.4] were seropositive for the SARS-CoV-2.

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0-10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation.

The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18-60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18-60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292-20â€‰672] vs 21â€‰395 AU/mL [14â€‰831-33â€‰553]; p&lt;0Â·0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629-16â€‰141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0-7]; p&lt;0Â·0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0-45]; p&lt;0Â·0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0-1218]; p=0Â·0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1-2319]; p&lt;0Â·0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses.

All patients over 60 years old admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 infection (or their legally acceptable representative) will be proposed to enter the study and to fill in a questionnaire regarding their functional and nutritional parameters 1â€‰month before COVID-19 infection. Paraclinical parameters at ICU admission will be collected: lymphocytes and neutrophils counts, high-fluorescent lymphoid cells and immature granulocytes percentages (Sysmex data), D-dimers, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, CT scan for lung extension rate as well as clinical resuscitation scores, and the delay between the first signs of infection and ICU admission. The primary outcome will be the overall survival at day 30 post-ICU admission. The analysis of factors predicting mortality at day 30 will be carried out using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions.

Following the hypothesis from our pilot study, we now validate an algorithm harnessing urinalysis to predict the outcome and the need for ICU resources on admission to hospital. Patients were screened for urinalysis, serum albumin (SA) and antithrombin III activity (AT-III) obtained prospectively on admission. The risk for an unfavorable course was categorized as (1) ""low"", (2) ""intermediate"" or (3) ""high"", depending on (1) normal urinalysis, (2) abnormal urinalysis with SA â‰¥ 2 g/dL and AT-III â‰¥ 70%, or (3) abnormal urinalysis with SA or AT-III abnormality. Time to ICU admission or death served as the primary endpoint. Among 223 screened patients, 145 were eligible for enrollment, 43 falling into the low, 84 intermediate, and 18 into high-risk categories. An abnormal urinalysis significantly elevated the risk for ICU admission or death (63.7% vs. 27.9%; HR 2.6; 95%-CI 1.4 to 4.9; <i>p</i> = 0.0020) and was 100% in the high-risk group.

Our objectives were to assess, in real-life conditions, the diagnostic accuracy of a nasopharyngeal point-of-care antigen (Ag) test and of saliva NAAT for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in ambulatory care. This was a prospective cohort study from 19 October through 18 December 2020 in two community COVID-19 screening centers in Paris, France. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and one saliva sample were simultaneously collected. Diagnostic accuracies of nasopharyngeal Ag testing and of three saliva NAAT methods were assessed as compared to nasopharyngeal NAAT. A total of 1452 ambulatory children and adults were included. Overall, 129/1443 (9%) participants tested positive on nasopharyngeal NAAT (102/564 [18%] in symptomatic and 27/879 [3%] in asymptomatic participants). Sensitivity was 94%, 23%, 96%, and 94% for the three different protocols of saliva NAAT and for the nasopharyngeal Ag test, respectively. Estimates of specificity were above 95% for all methods. Diagnostic accuracy was similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal Ag testing and of saliva NAAT is similar to that of nasopharyngeal NAAT, subject to compliance with specific protocols for saliva.

The clinical role of chest computed tomography (CT) in describing the progression of COVID-19-associated lung injury remains to be clarified. We investigated in COVID-19 patients the regional distribution of lung injury and the influence of clinical and laboratory features on its progression.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This was a prospective study. For each CT, twenty images, evenly spaced along the cranio-caudal axis, were selected. For regional analysis, each CT image was divided into three concentric subpleural regions of interest and four quadrants. Hyper-, normally, hypo- and non-inflated lung compartments were defined. Nonparametric tests were used for hypothesis testing (Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05). Spearman correlation test was used to detect correlations between lung compartments and clinical features.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Twenty-three out of 111 recruited patients were eligible for further analysis. Five hundred-sixty CT images were analyzed. Lung injury, composed by hypo- and non-inflated areas, was significantly more represented in subpleural than in core lung regions. A secondary, centripetal spread of lung injury was associated with exposure to mechanical ventilation (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.04), longer spontaneous breathing (more than 14Â days, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) and non-protective tidal volume (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.04).

Evidence from Africa indicates that significantly less COVID-19 patients suffer from serious symptoms than in the industrialized world. We and others previously postulated a partial explanation for this phenomenon, being a different, more activated immune system due to parasite infections. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating a potential correlation of co-infection with parasites with COVID-19 severity in an endemic area in Africa. <i>Methods:</i> Ethiopian COVID-19 patients were enrolled and screened for intestinal parasites, between July 2020 and March 2021. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between parasite infection, and COVID-19 severity. Models were adjusted for sex, age, residence, education level, occupation, body mass index, and comorbidities. <i>Findings:</i> 751 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, of whom 284 (37.8%) had intestinal parasitic infection. Only 27/255 (10.6%) severe COVID-19 patients were co-infected with intestinal parasites, while 257/496 (51.8%) non-severe COVID-19 patients were parasite positive (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). Patients co-infected with parasites had lower odds of developing severe COVID-19, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17-0.30; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for all parasites, aOR 0.37 ([95% CI 0.26-0.51]; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for protozoa, and aOR 0.26 ([95% CI 0.19-0.35]; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for helminths. When stratified by species, co-infection with <i>Entamoeba</i> spp., <i>Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni</i>, and <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> implied lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. There were 11 deaths (1.5%), and all were among patients without parasites (<i>p</i>Â =Â 0.009). <i>Interpretation:</i> Parasite co-infection is associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in African patients.

These changes were compared by municipal and hospital characteristics. <b>Results:</b> Questionnaires were collected from a representative sample of 11,806 physicians actively practicing obstetrics and gynecology in 779 hospitals from 157 cities of 31 provinces. Except emergency visits and online consultations, category 3 cities, tertiary hospitals and general hospitals had greater reductions in overall clinical activities than category 1 cities, primary hospitals and specialized hospitals (all adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), respectively. The differences also existed in the management of specific diseases and conditions, especially for less urgent conditions, including cervical cancer screening, instructions regarding contraception and miscarriage, and assisted reproduction (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinical obstetrics and gynecology activities in China markedly decreased, with significant differences across municipal and hospital characteristics. <b>Trial Registration:</b> This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on July 27, 2020 (NCT04491201).</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Li, Cao, Fan, Li, Lang, Zhang, Lv, Zhu and Chinese Medical Doctor Association.</CopyrightInformation>",Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Clinical Activities in Obstetrics and Gynecology: A National Survey in China.,Journal Article, , ,2021-09-20,Frontiers in medicine,NCT04491201,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34395457,NA

We aimed to investigate the effect of different immunosuppressive drugs on antibody development after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">In this study, we used serum samples collected from patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy controls who were included in two ongoing prospective cohort studies in the Netherlands. Participants were eligible for inclusion in this substudy if they had been vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine via the Dutch national vaccine programme, which at the time was prioritising vaccination of older individuals. Samples were collected after the first or second COVID-19 vaccination. No serial samples were collected. Seroconversion rates and IgG antibody titres against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between medication use at the time of vaccination and at least until sampling, seroconversion rates, and IgG antibody titres. The studies from which data were collected are registered on the Netherlands Trial Register, Trial ID NL8513, and ClinicalTrials.org, NCT04498286.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Findings"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Between April 26, 2020, and March 1, 2021, 3682 patients with rheumatic diseases, 546 patients with multiple sclerosis, and 1147 healthy controls were recruited to participate in the two prospective cohort studies. Samples were collected from patients with autoimmune diseases (n=632) and healthy controls (n=289) after their first (507 patients and 239 controls) or second (125 patients and 50 controls) COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age of both patients and controls was 63 years (SD 11), and 423 (67%) of 632 patients with autoimmune diseases and 195 (67%) of 289 controls were female. Among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion after first vaccination were significantly lower in patients than in controls (210 [49%] of 432 patients <i>vs</i> 154 [73%] of 210 controls; adjusted odds ratio 0Â·33 [95% CI 0Â·23-0Â·48]; p&lt;0Â·0001), mainly due to lower seroconversion in patients treated with methotrexate or anti-CD20 therapies. After the second vaccination, seroconversion exceeded 80% in all patient treatment subgroups, except among those treated with anti-CD20 therapies (three [43%] of seven patients). We observed no difference in seroconversion and IgG antibody titres between patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who had received a single vaccine dose (72 [96%] of 75 patients, median IgG titre 127 AU/mL [IQR 27-300]) and patients without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who had received two vaccine doses (97 [92%] of 106 patients, median IgG titre 49 AU/mL [17-134]).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Interpretation"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Our data suggest that seroconversion after a first COVID-19 vaccination is delayed in older patients on specific immunosuppressive drugs, but that second or repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2, either via infection or vaccination, improves humoral immunity in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, delayed second dosing of COVID-19 vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs. Future studies that include younger patients need to be done to confirm the generalisability of our results.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Funding"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">ZonMw, Reade Foundation, and MS Center Amsterdam.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>",Antibody development after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases in the Netherlands: a substudy of data from two prospective cohort studies.,Journal Article, , ,2021-08-17,The Lancet.

In this study, 1379 patients (35 sites) were enrolled, and a machine learning approach was used to fit models in a derivation cohort. A reduced Elastic Net model was selected, and the accuracy to predict the 28-day fatality after the COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), was confirmed in a validation cohort. The better calibration values were used to build the applicable ImAgeS score. The 28-day fatality rate was 17% (nÂ =Â 235), which was associated with increasing age, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, higher body mass index, dyspnea, and use of mycophenolate acid or azathioprine. Higher kidney graft function, longer time of symptoms until COVID-19 diagnosis, presence of anosmia or coryza, and use of mTOR inhibitor were associated with reduced risk of death. The coefficients of the best model were used to build the predictive score, which achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.767 (95% CI 0.698-0.834) in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the easily applicable predictive model could assist health care practitioners in identifying non-hospitalized kidney transplant patients that may require more intensive monitoring.

Of all the exposure variables, a reported SARS-CoV-2 case in the household was the strongest predictor for seropositivity at T1 (12.4 [5.8-26.7]) and T2 (10.8 [4.5-25.8]). At both time points, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater for exposure-based (T1, 0.69; T2, 0.64) than symptom-based prediction models (T1, 0.59; T2, 0.57). <b>Conclusions:</b> In children, retrospective identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infections based on symptoms is imprecise. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is better predicted by factors of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, especially reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in the household. Predicting SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in children in general is challenging, as few reliable predictors could be identified. For an accurate retrospective identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, serological tests are likely indispensable. <b>Trial registration number:</b> NCT04448717.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Blankenberger, Haile, Puhan, Berger, Radtke, Kriemler and Ulyte.</CopyrightInformation>",Prediction of Past SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Prospective Cohort Study Among Swiss Schoolchildren.,Journal Article, , ,2021-09-07,Frontiers in pediatrics,NCT04448717,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34485200,NA

In order to counter antibiotic overprescribing, antibiotic stewardship teams need reliable data concerning antibiotic prescribing in admitted patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">In this prospective observational cohort study, we performed a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of antibiotic prescriptions in patients admitted to the COVID-19 ward of a 721-bed Belgian university hospital between 1Â May and 2Â November 2020. Data on demographics, clinical and microbiological parameters and antibiotic consumption were collected. Defined daily doses (DDD) were calculated for antibiotics prescribed in the context of a (presumed) bacterial respiratory tract infection and converted into two indicators: DDD/admission and DDD/100 hospital bed days. A team of infectious disease specialists performed an appropriateness evaluation for every prescription. A driver analysis was performed to identify factors increasing the odds of an antibiotic prescription in patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Of 403 eligible participants with a suspected COVID-19 infection, 281 were included.

28875483,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">The soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (or presepsin) is a free fragment of glycoprotein expressed on monocytes and macrophages. Although many studies have been conducted recently, the diagnostic performance of presepsin for sepsis remains debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to assess the accuracy of presepsin for the diagnosis of sepsis in adult patients and compared the performance between presepsin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A comprehensive systemic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin for sepsis until January 2017. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic method was used to pool individual sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Eighteen studies, comprising 3470 patients, met our inclusion criteria. The pooled diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of presepsin for sepsis were 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.87) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.82), respectively. Furthermore, the pooled DOR, PLR, NLR, and AUC were 16 (95% CI 10-25), 3.4 (95% CI 2.5-4.6), 0.22 (95% CI 0.17-0.27), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90), respectively. Significant heterogeneity was found in both sensitivities (Cochrane QÂ =Â 137.43, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001, I <sup>2</sup>Â =Â 87.63%) and specificities (Cochrane QÂ =Â 180.76, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001, I <sup>2</sup>Â =Â 90.60%). Additionally, we found no significant difference between presepsin and PCT (AUC 0.87 vs. 0.86) or CRP (AUC 0.85 vs. 0.85). However, for studies conducted in ICU, the pooled sensitivity of presepsin was found to be higher than PCT (0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.92 vs. 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.81), while the pooled specificity of presepsin was lower than PCT (0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.73 vs. 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.83).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Based on the results of our meta-analysis, presepsin is a promising marker for diagnosis of sepsis as PCT or CRP, but its results should be interpreted more carefully and cautiously since too few studies were included and those studies had high heterogeneity between them. In addition, continuing re-evaluation during the course of sepsis is advisable.</AbstractText>","Comparison of diagnostic accuracy in sepsis between presepsin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",Journal Article, , ,2020-09-29,Annals of intensive care,NCT04840940,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28875483,NA

29420257,"<AbstractText>As disasters become increasingly prevalent, and reported on, a wealth of literature on post-disaster mental health has been published. Most published evidence focuses on symptoms of mental health problems (such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety) and psychosocial factors increasing the risk of such symptoms. However, a recent shift in the literature has moved to exploring resilience and the absence of adverse lasting mental health effects following a disaster. This paper undertakes a qualitative review of the literature to explore factors affecting psychological resilience, as well as the potential positive impact of experiencing a disaster (post-traumatic growth) by examining the literature on employees in disaster-exposed organisations. We identify several protective factors: training, experience, and perceived (personal) competence; social support; and effective coping strategies. Post-traumatic growth frequently appeared to occur at both personal and professional levels for those rescue staff after a disaster, giving employees a greater appreciation of life and their relationships, enhancing their self-esteem and providing a sense of accomplishment and better understanding of their work. Implications, in terms of how to build a resilient workforce, are discussed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2020.

30576221,"<AbstractText><b>Rationale:</b> One important concern during high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is to not delay intubation. <b>Objectives:</b> To validate the diagnostic accuracy of an index (termed ROX and defined as the ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry/Fi<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> to respiratory rate) for determining HFNC outcome (need or not for intubation). <b>Methods:</b> This was a 2-year multicenter prospective observational cohort study including patients with pneumonia treated with HFNC. Identification was through Cox proportional hazards modeling of ROX association with HFNC outcome. The most specific cutoff of the ROX index to predict HFNC failure and success was assessed. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Among the 191 patients treated with HFNC in the validation cohort, 68 (35.6%) required intubation. The prediction accuracy of the ROX index increased over time (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 2 h, 0.679; 6 h, 0.703; 12 h, 0.759). ROX greater than or equal to 4.88 measured at 2 (hazard ratio, 0.434; 95% confidence interval, 0.264-0.715; <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.001), 6 (hazard ratio, 0.304; 95% confidence interval, 0.182-0.509; <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), or 12 hours (hazard ratio, 0.291; 95% confidence interval, 0.161-0.524; <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) after HFNC initiation was consistently associated with a lower risk for intubation. A ROX less than 2.85, less than 3.47, and less than 3.85 at 2, 6, and 12 hours of HFNC initiation, respectively, were predictors of HFNC failure. Patients who failed presented a lower increase in the values of the ROX index over the 12 hours. Among components of the index, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry/Fi<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> had a greater weight than respiratory rate. <b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with pneumonia with acute respiratory failure treated with HFNC, ROX is an index that can help identify those patients with low and those with high risk for intubation.

30760036,"<AbstractText>The correct expression of circadian rhythmicity is crucial for the body homeostasis. The rest-activity circadian rhythms (RARs) are involved in the control of the sleep-wake cycle and altered RARs could lead to a compromised health status. Many studies focused on examining sleep behavior and circadian rhythms in physically active subjects or athletes but, unexpectedly, no data on RARs are available. Therefore, we studied the existence of the RAR in athletes and the possible difference in RAR's characteristics among sport disciplines. The study had a prospective observational design and RARs were recorded for five consecutive training days through actigraphy (Actiwatch 2 actigraph; Philips Respironics, OR, USA) in 43 athletes (mean age: 25.6Â Â±Â 3.2Â years). Athletes competed in three different disciplines and had different training schedules and competition levels: professional triathletes (N =Â 10; 6 females and 4 males) had 2 morning (08:30-12:00) and 1 afternoon (15:00-17:00) training sessions, professional volleyball players (N =Â 19; 12 females and 7 males) used to train once in the morning (09:00-11:30) and once in the afternoon (15:00-18:00), and non-professional soccer players (N =Â 14; all males) trained always late in the evening (20:30-22:30). To determine the existence of RARs, the activity counts (A.C.) data were analyzed using the single and the population mean cosinor method; a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was used for the comparison of RAR characteristics among soccer, volleyball and triathlon athletes. Partial eta squared (Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) was used to determine the magnitude of the effect for significant outcomes (Î±Â =Â 0.05) in ANOVA. The presence of a significant RAR both for each of the 43 athletes (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and for the three categories of athletes (p &lt;Â 0.001) was observed. RARs differed among sport disciplines: the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm (MESOR) was significantly higher in triathletes (mean: 347 A.C. with 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 314-379) compared to both volleyball (mean: 188 A.C. with 95% CI: 173-203; p &lt;Â 0.001) and soccer players (mean: 289 A.C. with 95% CI: 267-312; p &lt;Â 0.01) with Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.72. Amplitude (A) values showed the same significant trend of MESOR data (ANOVA: p &lt;Â 0.001; Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.65) while the acrophase (Î¦) occurred at 18:28 for soccer players, significantly later than triathlon (15:20Â h; p &lt;Â 0.001) and volleyball players (16:24Â h; p &lt;Â 0.001) (ANOVA: p &lt;Â 0.001; Î®p2Â =Â 0.84). The higher training duration and intensity reached by triathlon athletes in the morning sessions caused a phase advance of their RAR's acrophase Î¦ and higher MESOR and A amplitude compared to volleyball players and triathletes. Therefore, different sport disciplines require different training schedules, training loads and intensities that translate into different RARs. Strength coaches and medical staff of professional teams should strongly consider actigraphy as a practical and powerful tool to monitor RARs, sleep behavior, and the activity levels of their athletes; highlighting potential circadian disruptions through actigraphy could be helpful to prevent musculoskeletal injuries.</AbstractText>",Athletes' rest-activity circadian rhythm differs in accordance with the sport discipline.,Journal Article|Observational Study, ,Adult|Circadian Rhythm|Exercise|Female|Humans|Male|Prospective Studies|Rest|Sleep|Sports|Young Adult|NA,2020-06-10,Chronobiology international,NCT04632615,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30760036,NA

In this open-label study, we assessed the histological efficacy of NGM282 in patients with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Paired liver biopsies from 43 patients who received subcutaneous NGM282 (1Â mg, nÂ =Â 24; 3Â mg, nÂ =Â 19) once daily for 12 weeks were evaluated blinded to time point, subject, and clinical information. At week 12, NGM282 significantly reduced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS; -1.9; 95% confidence interval, -2.6 to -1.2; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001 in the 1Â mg group; -2.2, -3.1 to -1.3; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001 in the 3Â mg group) and fibrosis (-0.5; -0.9 to 0; PÂ =Â 0.035 in the 3Â mg group) scores.

Of the patients receiving NGM282 1Â mg or 3Â mg, 25% and 42%, respectively, improved liver fibrosis by one stage or more without worsening of steatohepatitis. Treatment with NGM282 led to relative reductions in liver fat content (-58% and -67% in the 1Â mg and 3Â mg groups, respectively), corrected T1 (cT1; -8% and -9%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (-67% and -60%), aspartate aminotransferase (-57% and -52%), and fibrogenesis biomarkers neoepitope-specific N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (Pro-C3; -22% and -33%) and enhanced liver fibrosis score (ELF; -3% and -6%) at week 12.

Additional articles were identified by hand from references. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> We included English-language articles (excluding poster presentations) evaluating erenumab pharmacology, efficacy, or safety in humans for migraine prevention. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> Erenumab is a CGRP inhibitor that inhibits vasodilation in response to acute migraines, which decreases pain perception during the migraine. Erenumab efficacy and safety has only been compared with placebo, but its reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs) and medication response (â‰¥50% reduction in MMDs) are comparable to current recommended off-label therapies for migraine prevention in short-term treatment studies. Additionally, erenumab is associated with low adverse event burden with no difference found compared with placebo per published clinical trials. <b>Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice:</b> Erenumab is the first medication approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines in adults. No head-to-head data are available, but existing data suggest that erenumab is at least as effective as current off-label products and with reduced adverse effects. <b>Conclusion:</b> Erenumab is an effective once-monthly injectable agent for migraine prevention in patients with chronic or episodic migraine.

Oxidative stress was assessed using either a chemiluminescence assay to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) or an electrochemical assay to measure oxidation reduction potential (sORP). Sperm DNA fragmentation (DFI) and sperm with immature chromatin (HDS) were assessed using sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Semen analysis was performed according to WHO 2010 guidelines. Reactive oxygen species sORP and DFI are negatively correlated with sperm motility (<i>p</i> = 0.0012, 0.0002, &lt;0.0001 respectively) and vitality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001, 0.019, &lt;0.0001 respectively). The correlation was stronger for sORP than ROS. Reactive oxygen species (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), sORP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), DFI (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0089) and HDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) were significantly elevated in samples with abnormal semen parameters, compared to those with normal parameters. Samples with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have excessive ROS levels compared to those without (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), but sORP and DFI in this group are not significantly increased. DNA fragmentation was significantly elevated in samples with OS measured by ROS (<i>p</i> = 0.0052) or sORP (<i>p</i> = 0.004). The results demonstrate the multi-dimensional nature of oxidative stress and that neither assay can be used alone in the diagnosis of OS, especially in cases of leukocytospermia.</AbstractText>",A Comparison Between Two Assays for Measuring Seminal Oxidative Stress and their Relationship with Sperm DNA Fragmentation and Semen Parameters.,Comparative Study|Journal Article,Reactive Oxygen Species|NA,"DNA Fragmentation|Humans|Infertility, Male|Male|Oxidative Stress|Reactive Oxygen Species|Semen|Semen Analysis|Sperm Count|Sperm Motility|Spermatozoa|NA",2020-01-09,Genes,NCT04748172,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30893955,NA
30970039,"<AbstractText>As the burden of liver disease reaches epidemic levels, there is a high unmet medical need to develop robust, accurate and reproducible non-invasive methods to quantify liver tissue characteristics for use in clinical development and ultimately in clinical practice. This prospective cross-sectional study systematically examines the repeatability and reproducibility of iron-corrected T1 (cT1), T2*, and hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF) quantification with multiparametric MRI across different field strengths, scanner manufacturers and models. 61 adult participants with mixed liver disease aetiology and those without any history of liver disease underwent multiparametric MRI on combinations of 5 scanner models from two manufacturers (Siemens and Philips) at different field strengths (1.5T and 3T). We report high repeatability and reproducibility across different field strengths, manufacturers, and scanner models in standardized cT1 (repeatability CoV: 1.7%, bias -7.5ms, 95% LoA of -53.6 ms to 38.5 ms; reproducibility CoV 3.3%, bias 6.5 ms, 95% LoA of -76.3 to 89.2 ms) and T2* (repeatability CoV: 5.5%, bias -0.18 ms, 95% LoA -5.41 to 5.05 ms; reproducibility CoV 6.6%, bias -1.7 ms, 95% LoA -6.61 to 3.15 ms) in human measurements. PDFF repeatability (0.8%) and reproducibility (0.75%) coefficients showed high precision of this metric. Similar precision was observed in phantom measurements. Inspection of the ICC model indicated that most of the variance in cT1 could be accounted for by study participants (ICC = 0.91), with minimal contribution from technical differences. We demonstrate that multiparametric MRI is a non-invasive, repeatable and reproducible method for quantifying liver tissue characteristics across manufacturers (Philips and Siemens) and field strengths (1.5T and 3T).</AbstractText>",Repeatability and reproducibility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the liver.,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", ,"Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Cross-Sectional Studies|Female|Humans|Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted|Liver|Male|Middle Aged|Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease|Phantoms, Imaging|Prospective Studies|Reproducibility of Results|Young Adult|NA",2020-01-02,PloS one,NCT04369807,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30970039,NA

We questioned whether the number of circulating donor-specific IL-21 producing cells (pc) can predict kidney transplant rejection, and evaluated this in two different patient cohorts. The first analysis was done on pre-transplantation samples of 35 kidney transplant recipients of whom 15 patients developed an early acute rejection. The second study concerned peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 46 patients obtained at 6 months after kidney transplantation of whom 13 developed late rejection. Significantly higher frequencies of donor-specific IL-21 pc were found by Elispot assay in both patients who developed early and late rejection compared to those without rejection. In addition, low frequencies of donor-specific IL-21 pc were associated with higher rejection-free survival. Moreover, low pre-transplant donor-specific IL-21 pc numbers were associated with the absence of anti-HLA antibodies. Donor-reactive IL-21 was mainly produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including CD4<sup>+</sup> follicular T helper cells. In conclusion, the number of donor-specific IL-21 pc is associated with an increased risk of both early and late rejection, giving it the potential to be a new biomarker in kidney transplantation.</AbstractText>",The Number of Donor-Specific IL-21 Producing Cells Before and After Transplantation Predicts Kidney Graft Rejection.,Clinical Trial|Journal Article,Interleukins|interleukin-21|NA,"Adult|Aged|CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes|CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes|Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay|Female|Graft Rejection|Humans|Interleukins|Kidney Diseases|Kidney Transplantation|Leukocytes, Mononuclear|Male|Middle Aged|Tissue Donors|Young Adult|NA",2020-08-12,Frontiers in immunology,NCT04841785,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31024571,NA
31060085,"<AbstractText>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phenotype was first described over 50 years ago and since that time significant progress has been made in understanding the biologic processes underlying the syndrome. Despite this improved understanding, no pharmacologic therapies aimed at the underlying biology have been proven effective in ARDS. Increasingly, ARDS has been recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by subphenotypes with distinct clinical, radiographic, and biologic differences, distinct outcomes, and potentially distinct responses to therapy. The Berlin Definition of ARDS specifies three severity classifications: mild, moderate, and severe based on the PaO<sub>2</sub> to FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a potential benefit to prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade in moderate to severe phenotypes of ARDS only. Precipitating risk factor, direct versus indirect lung injury, and timing of ARDS onset can determine other clinical phenotypes of ARDS after admission. Radiographic phenotypes of ARDS have been described based on a diffuse versus focal pattern of infiltrates on chest imaging. Finally and most promisingly, biologic subphenotypes or endotypes have increasingly been identified using plasma biomarkers, genetics, and unbiased approaches such as latent class analysis. The potential of precision medicine lies in identifying novel therapeutics aimed at ARDS biology and the subpopulation within ARDS most likely to respond. In this review, we discuss the challenges and approaches to subphenotype ARDS into clinical, radiologic, severity, and biologic phenotypes with an eye toward the future of precision medicine in critical care.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</CopyrightInformation>",Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Phenotypes.,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review",Biomarkers|NA,Biomarkers|Humans|Patient Positioning|Phenotype|Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic|Respiratory Distress Syndrome|Risk Factors|Severity of Illness Index|NA,2020-04-21,Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,NCT04692779,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31060085,NA
31101987,"<AbstractText>Muscular weakness developing from critical illness neuropathy, myopathy and muscle atrophy has been characterized as intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). This entity occurs commonly during and after critical care stay. Various causal factors for functional incapacity have been proposed. Among these, individual patient characteristics (such as age, comorbidities and nutritional status), acting in association with sustained bed rest and pharmacological interventions (included the metabolic support approach), seem influential in reducing muscular mass. Long-term outcomes in heterogeneous ICUAW populations include transient disability in 30% of patients and persistent disabilities that may occur even in patients with nearly complete functional recovery. Currently available tools for the assessment of skeletal muscle mass are imprecise and difficult to perform in the ICU setting. A valid alternative to these imaging modalities is muscular ultrasonography, which allows visualization and classification of muscle characteristics by cross-sectional area, muscle layer thickness, echointensity by grayscale and the pennation angle). The aim of this narrative review is to describe the current literature addressing muscular ultrasound for the detection of muscle weakness and its potential impact on treatment and prognosis of critically ill patients when combined with biomarkers of muscle catabolism/anabolism and bioenergetic state.

31134099,"<AbstractText>With the rising prevalence of obesity has come an increasing awareness of its impact on communicable disease. As a consequence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, obesity was identified for the first time as a risk factor for increased disease severity and mortality in infected individuals. Over-nutrition that results in obesity causes a chronic state of meta-inflammation with systemic implications for immunity. Obese hosts exhibit delayed and blunted antiviral responses to influenza virus infection, and they experience poor recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines is reduced in this population and obesity may also play a role in altering the viral life cycle, thus complementing the already weakened immune response and leading to severe pathogenesis. Case studies and basic research in human cohorts and animal models have highlighted the prolonged viral shed in the obese host, as well as a microenvironment that permits the emergence of virulent minor variants. This review focuses on influenza A virus pathogenesis in the obese host, and on the impact of obesity on the antiviral response, viral shed, and viral evolution. We comprehensively analyze the recent literature on how and why viral pathogenesis is altered in the obese host along with the impact of the altered host and pathogenic state on viral evolutionary dynamics in multiple models. Finally, we summarized the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals in this populations and the questions that remain to be answered. If current trends continue, nearly 50% of the worldwide population is projected to be obese by 2050. This population will have a growing impact on both non-communicable and communicable diseases and may affect global evolutionary trends of influenza virus.</AbstractText>","Impact of Obesity on Influenza A Virus Pathogenesis, Immune Response, and Evolution.","Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review","Antibodies, Viral|Influenza Vaccines|NA","Animals|Antibodies, Viral|Disease Models, Animal|Humans|Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype|Influenza Vaccines|Influenza, Human|Lung|Mice|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Mice, Obese|Obesity|Orthomyxoviridae Infections|Risk Factors|NA",2020-06-01,Frontiers in immunology,NCT04480034,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31134099,NA

31265835,"<AbstractText>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extrusions of intracellular DNA and attached granular material that enable bacterial killing. NETs are increasingly recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. NETs are composed of a complex mix of intracellularly derived material that neutrophils organize within the cytoplasm and then expel in a nondirected manner in the vicinity of invading organisms. Combined, these trap and destroy multiple genera of microbes including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoans, limiting infection especially where phagocytosis is not possible. At first, NET formation was thought to be a terminal event for neutrophils; however, it is now apparent that some neutrophils survive this process, becoming anuclear, and may drive ongoing tissue damage. NETs are now known to be directly cytotoxic to lung epithelium and endothelium, and their excessive production is seen in pneumonia and acute lung injury as well as several chronic diseases, including COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. NETs also appear to play a role in both tumor defense and dissemination, depending on the local microenvironment and the specific tumor subtype. It is becoming increasingly apparent that NET formation can exert a positive or negative influence on multiple respiratory pathologies and that simply globally reducing or increasing NET formation is unlikely to be a therapeutic success. Rather, as our understanding grows, it is likely that targeted NET up- or downregulation along with destruction or protection of already formed NETs may become an additional point of intervention for respiratory physicians.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

31285919,"<AbstractText><b>Objective</b>: To review and present the most distinct concepts on the association of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with male reproduction. <b>Methods</b>: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to search PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane electronic databases for studies investigating the role of oxidative stress (OS) on sperm function. <b>Results</b>: The literature search yielded 1857 studies, of which 1791 articles were excluded because of irrelevance of data, non-English language, non-human nature or because they were case reports or commentaries. All included studies were reviews (46), meta-analyses (one), original research studies (18) and guideline articles (one). The studies were published between 1984 and 2018. Under normal physiological conditions, ROS are vital for sperm maturation, hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosome reaction, as well as fertilisation. However, a number of endogenous and exogenous causes may induce supra-physiological levels of ROS resulting in lipid peroxidation, sperm DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, and consequently infertility. Several laboratory testing methods can be used in infertile men to diagnose OS. Treatment usually involves antioxidant supplementation and, when possible, elimination of the causative factor. <b>Conclusion</b>: OS is an important cause of male factor infertility. Its assessment provides essential information that can guide treatment strategies aimed at improving the male's reproductive potential. <b>Abbreviations:</b> bp: base-pair; CAT: catalase; LPO: lipid peroxidation; MDA: malondialdehyde; MiOXSYS: Male Infertility Oxidative System; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; NAD(PH): nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); NO: nitric oxide; 8-OHdG: 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine; ORP: oxidation-reduction potential; OS: oxidative stress; PKA: protein kinase A; PLA2: phospholipase A2; PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PUFA: poly-unsaturated fatty acid; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; TAC: total antioxidant capacity; TBA: thiobarbituric acid.</AbstractText>",Oxidative stress and sperm function: A systematic review on evaluation and management.,Journal Article|Review, , ,2020-09-30,Arab journal of urology,NCT04748172,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31285919,NA

31608830,"<AbstractText>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sleep hygiene (SH) education on sleep quality in soccer players after a late-evening small-sided-game (SSG) training session. Twenty-nine non-professional players were recruited and allocated to either an experimental group (EG, n = 17) that received SH education, or a control group (CG, n = 12). SSG consisted of 3 Ã— 4 min in a 4vs4, with 3 min of recovery and was performed at 8.00 p.m. Sleep quality was monitored via actigraphy and sleep diary entries before (PRE) and two nights after (POST1, POST2) the SSG. Sleep latency (SL) differed between the two groups at POST1 (4.9 Â± 5.4 vs. 15.5 Â± 16.1 for EG and CG, respectively; p = 0.017, effect size [ES] = 2.0); SL values were lower at POST1 compared to PRE for the EG (-47%; p = 0.021, ES = 0.6). Subjective sleep quality was better in the EG than the CG at POST1 (8.6 Â± 1.0 vs. 7.1 Â± 2.0 for EG and CG, respectively; p = 0.016, ES = 0.9) with a significant improvement over PRE-values (+11.0%, p = 0.004, ES = 0.8). Although SL and subjective sleep quality did not decrease significantly from POST1 to POST2 values at POST2 no longer differed significantly form baseline and, hence, indicate that observed effects may be short-lasting. No other objective sleep indices were influenced by late-evening training or SH practices implemented by the EG. Soccer players may benefit from acute SH strategies to reduce the time to sleep onset after late-evening training sessions.</AbstractText>",Acute sleep hygiene strategy improves objective sleep latency following a late-evening soccer-specific training session: A randomized controlled trial.,Journal Article|Randomized Controlled Trial, ,"Actigraphy|Adult|Humans|Male|Physical Conditioning, Human|Sleep Hygiene|Sleep Latency|Soccer|Time Factors|Young Adult|NA",2020-01-07,Journal of sports sciences,NCT04632615,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31608830,NA

31849989,"<AbstractText>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been initially described as main actors in host defense owing to their ability to immobilize and sometimes kill microorganisms. Subsequent studies have demonstrated their implication in the pathophysiology of various diseases, due to the toxic effects of their main components on surrounding tissues. Several distinct NETosis pathways have been described in response to various triggers. Among these triggers, IgG immune complexes (IC) play an important role since they induce robust NET release upon binding to activating FcÎ³Rs on neutrophils. Few <i>in vitro</i> studies have documented the mechanisms of IC-induced NET release and evidence about the partners involved is controversial. <i>In vivo</i>, animal models and clinical studies have strongly suggested the importance of IgG IC-induced NET release for autoimmunity and anaphylaxis. In this review, we will focus on two autoimmune diseases in which NETs are undoubtedly major players, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We will also discuss anaphylaxis as another example of disease recently associated with IC-induced NET release. Understanding the role of IC-induced NETs in these settings will pave the way for new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2019 Granger, Peyneau, Chollet-Martin and de Chaisemartin.</CopyrightInformation>",Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Autoimmunity and Allergy: Immune Complexes at Work.,Journal Article|Review,Antigen-Antibody Complex|NA,Anaphylaxis|Animals|Antigen-Antibody Complex|Autoimmune Diseases|Autoimmunity|Extracellular Traps|Humans|Hypersensitivity|Neutrophils|NA,2020-11-19,Frontiers in immunology,NCT04594356,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31849989,NA

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methods-HFNC, HFNC+PP, NIV, NIV+PP-were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>â€‰&lt;â€‰100â€‰mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> in HFNC+PP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125â€‰Â±â€‰41â€‰mmHg vs 119â€‰Â±â€‰19â€‰mmHg, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated an upward trend in patients with all four support strategies: HFNC &lt; HFNC+PP â‰¤ NIV &lt; NIV+PP. The average duration for PP was 2â€‰h twice daily.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Early application of PP with HFNC, especially in patients with moderate ARDS and baseline SpO<sub>2</sub>â€‰&gt;â€‰95%, may help avoid intubation.

32007145,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99Â·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans<sup>5-7</sup>. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.</AbstractText>",A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.,Journal Article,"Antibodies, Viral|Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A|ACE2 protein, human|Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2|NA","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2|Animals|Antibodies, Viral|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Cell Line|China|Chiroptera|Chlorocebus aethiops|Coronavirus Infections|Disease Outbreaks|Female|Genome, Viral|Humans|Male|Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A|Phylogeny|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS Virus|SARS-CoV-2|Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|Vero Cells|NA",2020-03-20,Nature,NCT04861402,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32015507,NA

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>",Potential interventions for novel coronavirus in China: A systematic review.,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Systematic Review",Antiviral Agents|COVID-19 Vaccines|Immunologic Factors|Trace Elements|Viral Vaccines|Vitamins|NA,"Antiviral Agents|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|COVID-19 Vaccines|China|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|Immunization, Passive|Immunologic Factors|Nutritional Status|Plasma|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Trace Elements|Viral Vaccines|Vitamins|NA",2020-03-18,Journal of medical virology,NCT04367883,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32052466,NA
32053470,"<AbstractText>Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (Â±standard deviation) of 4 days Â± 1 (range, 1-8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days Â± 4 (range, 11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.25, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0-4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 Â± 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5-8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 Â± 4; <i>P</i> = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9-13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 Â± 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (â‰¥14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 Â± 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.

Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified.

32081636,"<AbstractText>The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with &gt;99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32096367,"<AbstractText>The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.</AbstractText>",[Management of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19): the Zhejiang experience].,Journal Article,Antiviral Agents|NA,"Antibiotic Prophylaxis|Antiviral Agents|COVID-19|China|Coronavirus Infections|Critical Illness|Humans|Medicine, Chinese Traditional|Nutritional Support|Pneumonia, Viral|Respiration, Artificial|Shock|Stress, Psychological|Water-Electrolyte Balance|NA",2020-03-16,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days Â± 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days Â± 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.

32112714,"<AbstractText>The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.

32129518,"<AbstractText>At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>",Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.,Journal Article,"Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers|Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists|Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A|ACE2 protein, human|Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2|NA","Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers|Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists|Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2|Betacoronavirus|Binding Sites|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|Pandemics|Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-08-10,Drug development research,NCT04369807,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32129518,NA
32134861,"<AbstractText>In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.</AbstractText>",The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview.,Journal Article, ,"Asia|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|China|Coronavirus Infections|Global Health|Humans|Infection Control|Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|United States|NA",2020-03-18,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,NCT04344145,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134861,NA

MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.</AbstractText>","Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",Comparative Study|Journal Article, ,"Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|Pneumonia, Viral|Prevalence|SARS-CoV-2|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|NA",2020-03-18,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,NCT04344145,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141570,NA

Purpose To assess the performance of radiologists in the United States and China in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia at chest CT. Materials and Methods In this study, 219 patients with positive COVID-19, as determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and abnormal chest CT findings, were retrospectively identified from seven Chinese hospitals in Hunan Province, China, from January 6 to February 20, 2020. Two hundred five patients with positive respiratory pathogen panel results for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia, according to original radiologic interpretation within 7 days of each other, were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three radiologists from China reviewed all chest CT scans (<i>n</i> = 424) blinded to RT-PCR findings to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched patients was randomly selected and evaluated by four radiologists from the United States in a similar fashion.

We found that the SARS-CoV-2Â S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S<sub>1</sub>/S<sub>2</sub> subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs.

32155789,"<AbstractText><i>Background:</i> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.</AbstractText>",Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China.,Journal Article, ,"Adolescent|Adult|Aged|Anxiety|Anxiety Disorders|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Child|China|Coronavirus|Coronavirus Infections|Cross-Sectional Studies|Depression|Disease Outbreaks|Epidemics|Female|Health Status|Humans|Male|Mental Health|Middle Aged|Pneumonia, Viral|Resilience, Psychological|SARS-CoV-2|Surveys and Questionnaires|Young Adult|NA",2020-03-18,International journal of environmental research and public health,NCT04769284,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155789,NA

The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection an international public health emergency. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

32178769,"<AbstractText>The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30â€ˆ000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI): 82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI: 46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.

As little is currently known about SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that lessons learned from these major epidemics can be applied to the new pandemic, including the use of novel immunosuppressive drugs.</AbstractText>","COVID-19, cytokines and immunosuppression: what can we learn from severe acute respiratory syndrome?",Journal Article|Review,Anti-Inflammatory Agents|Antirheumatic Agents|Cytokines|NA,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents|Antirheumatic Agents|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|China|Coronavirus Infections|Cytokines|Humans|Infection Control|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|NA",2020-04-03,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,NCT04594356,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32202240,NA

32217113,"<AbstractText>The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2-2.5, indicating that 2-3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 7000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious 2 weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance, which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission, and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery, is addressed. In addition, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment, and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework that can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32217835,"<AbstractText>BACKGROUNDSince December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-Î±. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).</AbstractText>",Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019.,Journal Article|Observational Study,Cytokines|NA,"Adult|Aged|COVID-19|Cell Count|China|Coronavirus Infections|Cytokines|Female|Gene Expression Profiling|Gene Expression Regulation|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Retrospective Studies|Severity of Illness Index|T-Lymphocytes|NA",2020-05-06,The Journal of clinical investigation,NCT04594356,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32217835,NA

Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection. As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health. To provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of development of measures in this review.</AbstractText>","Virology, Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Control of COVID-19.",Journal Article|Review,Antiviral Agents|COVID-19 Vaccines|Viral Vaccines|NA,"Antiviral Agents|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|COVID-19 Testing|COVID-19 Vaccines|China|Clinical Laboratory Techniques|Coronavirus Infections|Genome, Viral|Humans|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Public Health|SARS-CoV-2|Viral Vaccines|NA",2020-04-03,Viruses,NCT04861402,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32230900,NA

Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+âˆ¼3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+âˆ¼3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.

A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century. The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease. The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic.

32252338,"<AbstractText>The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.</AbstractText>",Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths.,Journal Article|Review,Vitamin D|NA,"Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Dietary Supplements|Humans|Influenza, Human|Nutrition Therapy|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Risk Factors|SARS-CoV-2|Seasons|Vitamin D|Vitamin D Deficiency|NA",2020-04-10,Nutrients,NCT04441814,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32252338,NA
32253318,"<AbstractText>Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 Ã— 10<sup>9</sup>/L vs. 0.76 Ã— 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

32254064,"<AbstractText>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, including evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow, and proposed clinical trials, as scale-up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource.</AbstractText>",Deployment of convalescent plasma for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review","Antibodies, Viral|NA","Antibodies, Viral|Betacoronavirus|Blood Donors|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|Immunization, Passive|Investigational New Drug Application|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Risk Assessment|SARS-CoV-2|United States|United States Food and Drug Administration|NA",2020-06-11,The Journal of clinical investigation,NCT05046652,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32254064,NA

Compared with other monitoring modalities, such as auscultation or radiographic imaging, we argue lung ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy, is ergonomically favourable and has fewer infection control implications. By informing the initiation, escalation, titration and weaning of respiratory support, lung ultrasound can be integrated into COVID-19 care pathways for patients with respiratory failure. Given the unprecedented pressure on healthcare services currently, supporting and educating clinicians is a key enabler of the wider implementation of lung ultrasound. This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19-associated lung injury.

32299202,"<AbstractText>In the Wuhan Province of China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract leading to an acute respiratory syndrome. Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines â€œcytokine stormâ€ leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</CopyrightInformation>","COVID-19, immune system response, hyperinflammation and repurposing antirheumatic drugs",Journal Article|Review,Anti-Inflammatory Agents|Antirheumatic Agents|Cytokines|Immunosuppressive Agents|NA,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents|Antirheumatic Agents|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Cytokines|Drug Repositioning|Humans|Immune System|Immunity, Cellular|Immunosuppressive Agents|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-04-22,Turkish journal of medical sciences,NCT04819165,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32299202,NA

32323460,"<AbstractText>The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a drastic impact on national health care systems. Given the overwhelming demand on facility capacity, the impact on all health care sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of health care capacities. In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis. This study offers a novel approach to informed guidance for health care management when a priori no scientific evidence is available.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

The National Haemoglobinopathy Panel (NHP) has issued guidance on the care of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA), sideroblastic anaemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency and other red cell enzyme and membrane disorders. Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy. Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection. Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions. Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice. With the current lack of evidence on the risk and complications of COVID-19 infection in these patients, national data collection is ongoing to record outcomes and eventually to identify predictors of disease severity, particularly important if further waves of infection travel through the population.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>",Protecting vulnerable patients with inherited anaemias from unnecessary death during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Journal Article, ,"Anemia|Betacoronavirus|Blood Transfusion|Bone Marrow Transplantation|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Cross Infection|Humans|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-05-19,British journal of haematology,NCT04526405,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32330288,NA

32339082,"<AbstractText>Background A categorical CT assessment scheme for suspicion of pulmonary involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 provides a basis for gathering scientific evidence and improved communication with referring physicians. Purpose To introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for use in the standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on unenhanced chest CT images and to report its initial interobserver agreement and performance. Materials and Methods The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated by using 105 chest CT scans of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and in whom reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed (mean, 62 years Â± 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR results). Eight observers used CO-RADS to assess the scans. Fleiss Îº value was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared with the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared with results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss Îº value was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 0.47), with the highest Îº value for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false-negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was nine of 161 cases (5.6%; 95% CI: 1.0%, 10%), and the false-positive rate for CO-RADS category 5 was one of 286 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0%, 1.0%). Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 at unenhanced chest CT that performs very well in predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.

Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases. Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU. The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P valuesÂ &lt;Â 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925.

Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic.

32360126,"<AbstractText>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly progressed to a global health emergency. Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8Â % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23Â % in the following month and even more by 33Â % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25Â %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise du Cancer.

32437679,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and assessment of study quality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12Â·2 years (SD 4Â·1) to 68Â·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27Â·9%; 95% CI 20Â·5-36Â·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32Â·6%; 24Â·7-40Â·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35Â·7%; 27Â·6-44Â·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34Â·1%; 26Â·2-42Â·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41Â·9%; 22Â·5-50Â·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0Â·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10Â·5%; 95% CI 7Â·5-14Â·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12Â·1%; 8Â·6-16Â·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12Â·3%; 7Â·7-17Â·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12Â·8%; 8Â·7-17Â·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18Â·9%; 14Â·1-24Â·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19Â·3%; 15Â·1-23Â·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30Â·4%; 23Â·9-37Â·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100Â·0%; 88Â·0-100Â·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32Â·2% (95% CI 23Â·7-42Â·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14Â·9% (12Â·1-18Â·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14Â·8% (11Â·1-19Â·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76Â·9%; 95% CI 68Â·1-84Â·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35Â·3 months (SD 40Â·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Wellcome Trust, UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK Medical Research Council, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University College London.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

32437877,"<AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time. This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patients' long-term survival.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""PATIENTS AND METHODS"">We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of 3 and 6 months and periods of disruption of 1 and 2 years. Using health care resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained (LYGs) from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Per year, 94 912 resections for major cancers result in 80 406 long-term survivors and 1 717 051 LYGs. Per-patient delay of 3/6 months would cause attributable death of 4755/10 760 of these individuals with loss of 92 214/208 275 life-years, respectively. For cancer surgery, average LYGs per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of 3/6 months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYGs per patient), respectively. Taking into account health care resource units (HCRUs), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of 3/6 months. For 94 912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482 022 LYGs requiring 1 052 949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of 3/6 months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of LYGs, respectively, by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59%, respectively, when considering RALYGs. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

32454138,"<AbstractText>We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake) for COVID-19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage to hospitalisation. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4Â Â±Â 8.8Â yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52-7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10-16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

All measures are in line with the recommendations provided by the World Health Organization. Scientific societies, such as the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine, have provided recommendations and guidance to overcome and flatten the growing curve of infection in patients who undergo IVF treatments. Although there is as yet no evidence that the virus causing COVID-19 might have negative effects on IVF outcomes, fertility treatments have been postponed in order to support healthcare systems by avoiding placing them under additional stress. The possibility of the virus affecting sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded. In addition, an indirect effect of the virus on gametes and embryos during their manipulation cannot be ruled out.

32499236,"<AbstractText>The initial mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of ACE2, which is mainly expressed in the lung. Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32503173,"<AbstractText>The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019 in China, which later developed into a pandemic, has forced different countries to implement strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures. Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (<i>n</i> = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean Â± SD 3.0 Â± 1.6 kg) and loss (-2.9 Â± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36-45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.</AbstractText>",Dietary Choices and Habits during COVID-19 Lockdown: Experience from Poland.,Journal Article, ,"Adolescent|Adult|Alcohol Drinking|Betacoronavirus|Body Mass Index|COVID-19|Choice Behavior|Coronavirus Infections|Cross-Sectional Studies|Diet|Feeding Behavior|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Poland|Quarantine|SARS-CoV-2|Smoking|Snacks|Weight Gain|Young Adult|NA",2020-06-15,Nutrients,NCT04700254,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32503173,NA

32512122,"<AbstractText>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with millions affected and millions more at risk for contracting the infection. The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems, especially the lungs and heart. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. In our review of clinical analyses, we found that in 26 studies including 11,685 patients, the weighted pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was 20% (ranged from 5% to 38% depending on the criteria used). The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and 'endotheliitis' in several organs including the heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification. In patients with elevated hs-troponin, clinical context is important and myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential, along with type I and type II myocardial infarction. Irrespective of etiology, patients with acute myocardial injury should be prioritized for treatment. Clinical decisions including interventions should be individualized and carefully tailored after thorough review of risks/benefits. Given the complex interplay of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, further investigation into potential mechanisms is needed to guide effective therapies. Randomized trials are urgently needed to investigate treatment modalities to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with COVID-19 related acute myocardial injury.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰12Â years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity).

32531892,"<AbstractText>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dietary behaviours of the Spanish adult population were changed during the COVID-19 outbreak confinement. For that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling. A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire. Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits. Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 Â± 2 to 7.34 Â± 1.93 during the confinement. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement. COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet. This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.</AbstractText>",Changes in Dietary Behaviours during the COVID-19 Outbreak Confinement in the Spanish COVIDiet Study.,Journal Article, ,"Adult|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Diet Surveys|Diet, Mediterranean|Feeding Behavior|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Quarantine|SARS-CoV-2|Spain|NA",2020-07-02,Nutrients,NCT04449731,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32531892,NA

32563134,"<AbstractText>In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO<sub>2</sub>]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment.

The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, and median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with VD levels (<i>P</i> =0.004) but negatively correlated with PTH levels (<i>P</i> =0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially â‰¤2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidences of organ injury and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and 28-day mortality were 0.923 (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001), 0.905 (<i>P</i> =0.001), and 0.929 (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001), respectively. In conclusion, serum calcium was associated with the clinical severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced VD and PTH levels.</AbstractText>",Serum calcium as a biomarker of clinical severity and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Biomarkers|Calcium|NA,"Aged|Betacoronavirus|Biomarkers|COVID-19|Calcium|Coronavirus Infections|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Prognosis|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-07-20,Aging,NCT04662437,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32589164,NA
32594085,"<AbstractText>Hemoperfusion (HP) was helpful to prevent the development and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), liver failure, and septic shock by removing cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and ultimately preventing progression toward multiple organ failure. A 54-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The patient's O2 saturation was 80% using an oxygen mask, which was gradually declining. After 4 sessions of HP/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), O2 saturation reached to 95%, and the patient was transferred to the general ward. Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's dependence on oxygen, prevented other complications such as AKI and septic shock in the patient, and reduced mortality and hospital length of stay.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 S.

Several factors such as drugs, trauma, and emotional and physiological stress can lead to the development of telogen effluvium. Multiple alterations in the hair cycle have been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Telogen effluvium can present as acute or chronic hair fall with symptoms such as trichodynia. Diagnostic tests that can be used include hair wash test, trichogram, phototrichogram, and scalp biopsy. In the treatment of telogen effluvium, it is essential to identify and remove the causative factors and to use drugs such as corticosteroids, minoxidil, and novel treatments such as CNPDA (caffeine, niacinamide, panthenol, dimethicone, and an acrylate polymer).

COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets or direct contact and infects the respiratory tract resulting in pneumonia in most of the cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in about 15 % of the cases. Mortality in COVID-19 patients has been linked to the presence of the so-called ""cytokine storm"" induced by the virus. Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines leads to ARDS aggravation and widespread tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure and death.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</CopyrightInformation>",Evaluation of sex-related hormones and semen characteristics in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients.,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Gonadal Steroid Hormones|Testosterone|NA,Adult|COVID-19|Gonadal Steroid Hormones|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Semen|Semen Analysis|Testosterone|Young Adult|NA,2021-03-02,Journal of medical virology,NCT04643522,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32621617,NA

Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeated multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).

32692769,"<AbstractText>COVID-19 pneumonia typically begins with subpleural ground glass opacities with progressive extension on computerized tomography studies. Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30th. LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.</AbstractText>",Lung ultrasound score to monitor COVID-19 pneumonia progression in patients with ARDS.,Journal Article, ,"Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Disease Progression|Female|France|Humans|Intensive Care Units|Lung|Male|Middle Aged|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated|Pneumonia, Viral|Respiratory Distress Syndrome|SARS-CoV-2|Tomography, X-Ray Computed|Ultrasonography|NA",2020-08-03,PloS one,NCT04689672,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32692769,NA

However, so far no approved vaccine or drug therapy is available for treatment of virus infection. Convalescent plasma has been considered a potential modality for COVID-19 infection. One hundred eighty-nine COVID-19 positive patients including 115 patients in plasma therapy group and 74 patients in control group, registered in the hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, entered this multi-center clinical study. Comparison of outcomes including all-cause mortality, total hospitalization days and patients' need for intubation between the two patient groups shows that total of 98 (98.2 %) of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged from hospital which is substantially higher compared to 56 (78.7 %) patients in control group. Length of hospitalization days was significantly lower (9.54 days) in convalescent plasma group compared with that of control group (12.88 days). Only 8 patients (7%) in convalescent plasma group required intubation while that was 20 % in control group. This clinical study provides strong evidence to support the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients and recommends this treatment for management of these patients. Clinical efficacy, immediate availability and potential cost effectiveness could be considered as main advantages of convalescent plasma therapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT<sub>50</sub>]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA<sub>50</sub>, MNA<sub>80</sub>, and MNA<sub>90</sub>]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events.

Because of the novelty of the disease, the possible impact on the endocrine system is not clear. To compile a mini-review describing possible endocrine consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a literature survey using the key words Covid-19, Coronavirus, SARS CoV-1, SARS Cov-2, Endocrine, and related terms in medical databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and MedARXiv from the year 2000. Additional references were identified through manual screening of bibliographies and via citations in the selected articles. The literature review is current until April 28, 2020. In light of the literature, we discuss SARS-CoV-2 and explore the endocrine consequences based on the experience with structurally-similar SARS-CoV-1. Studies from the SARS -CoV-1 epidemic have reported variable changes in the endocrine organs. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 system in the pancreas causing perturbation of insulin production resulting in hyperglycemic emergencies. In patients with preexisting endocrine disorders who develop COVID-19, several factors warrant management decisions. Hydrocortisone dose adjustments are required in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Identification and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is crucial. Patients with Cushing syndrome may have poorer outcomes because of the associated immunodeficiency and coagulopathy. Vitamin D deficiency appears to be associated with increased susceptibility or severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and replacement may improve outcomes. Robust strategies required for the optimal management of endocrinopathies in COVID-19 are discussed extensively in this mini-review.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Endocrine Society 2020.</CopyrightInformation>",The Impact of SARS-Cov-2 Virus Infection on the Endocrine System.,Journal Article|Review, , ,2020-09-28,Journal of the Endocrine Society,NCT04662437,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32728654,NA

32835303,"<AbstractText>SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is causing a devastating worldwide pandemic, and there is a pressing need to understand the development, specificity, and neutralizing potency of humoral immune responses during acute infection. We report a cross-sectional study of antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and virus neutralization activity in a cohort of 44 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RBD-specific IgG responses are detectable in all patients 6Â days after PCR confirmation. Isotype switching to IgG occurs rapidly, primarily to IgG1 and IgG3. Using a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate, neutralizing antibody titers are detectable in all patients by 6Â days after PCR confirmation and correlate with RBD-specific binding IgG titers. The RBD-specific binding data were further validated in a clinical setting with 231 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. These findings have implications for understanding protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, therapeutic use of immune plasma, and development of much-needed vaccines.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>",Rapid Generation of Neutralizing Antibody Responses in COVID-19 Patients.,Journal Article, , ,2021-09-14,Cell reports.

We analyzed data from a multicenter cohort study of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the United States from March 4 to May 8, 2020. From 4153 patients, we created a propensity score matched cohort of 386 patients, including 98 SOT patients and 288 non-SOT patients. We used a binomial generalized linear model (log-binomial model) to examine the association of SOT status with death and other clinical outcomes. Among the 386 patients, the median age was 60Â years, 72% were male, and 41% were black. Death within 28Â days of ICU admission was similar in SOT and non-SOT patients (40% and 43%, respectively; relative risk [RR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-1.22). Other outcomes and requirement for organ support including receipt of mechanical ventilation, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and receipt of vasopressors were also similar between groups. There was a trend toward higher risk of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy in SOT vs. non-SOT patients (37% vs. 27%; RR [95% CI]: 1.34 [0.97-1.85]).

To this end, we designed a prospective study (NCT04365322) that included 60 COVID-19 convalescent patients (1-month post infection) in two cohorts respectively entitled mild illness and severe pneumonia. The monitoring of peripheral immune responses was performed using IFNáµ§ ELISpot assay. The serology index of each patient was investigated at the same time. Patients with severe pneumonia were older and had more comorbidities than patients with mild illness. T-cell responses in term of frequency and intensity were clearly distinct between mild illness and severe pneumonia patients. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that recent history of COVID-19 did not hamper viral memory T-cell pool against common viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr-virus and Flu-virus).

32868447,"<AbstractText>The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in &gt;5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

All patients underwent bedside lung ultrasonography one to two times per day. The patients were either intubated, treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or given high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after a discussion with the multidisciplinary group after their conditions worsened. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed daily after intubation, and patients received mechanical ventilation. Lung ultrasound was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after patients were admitted to the ICU; if the patient was intubated, LUS determination was performed before intubation within 24 h (T1) and on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after intubation (T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively).The goal of this study was to evaluate the severity of lung aeration loss in intubated and non-intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by ultrasound at different time points within one week.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 16 patients were included in this study, including nine who were intubated and mechanically ventilated and seven patients without intubation.

Patient characteristics (BMI, SOFA, and PaO2/FiO2 value) were similar between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate of intubated patients was higher than that of non-intubated patients; six patients in the intubated group and two patients in the non-intubated group died.

32912598,"<AbstractText>This study aims to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on cognitive functions in recovered patients and its relationship with inflammatory profiles. Twenty-nine patients recovered from COVID-19 as confirmed by negative nucleic tests for two consecutive times were recruited. A total of 29 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls were also recruited. The cognitive functions of all subjects were evaluated by the iPad-based online neuropsychological tests, including the Trail Making Test (TMT), Sign Coding Test (SCT), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and Digital Span Test (DST). Blood samples from all patients were collected for examining inflammatory profiles, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The relationship between cognitive functions and inflammatory profiles were analyzed by Pearson correlation. In results, although no significant differences were found in TMT, SCT, and DST between the two groups, patients with COVID-19 scored lower in the correct number of the second and third parts of CPT, they also scored higher in the missing number of the third part of CPT (all PÂ &lt;Â 0.05). In patients with COVID-19, there was a trend of significant difference for lower reaction time in the first and second parts of CPT (PÂ =Â 0.050, and 0.051, respectively), as well as the lower correct number of the second part of CPT (PÂ =Â 0.050).

Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses<sup>2,3</sup>. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed<sup>1,2</sup>. This retrospective, propensity score-matched case-control study assessed the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in 39 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Oxygen requirements on day 14 after transfusion worsened in 17.9% of plasma recipients versus 28.2% of propensity score-matched controls who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.98; chi-square test P valueâ€‰=â€‰0.025).

This study in top elite athletes aimed to study current perceived psychological influence from COVID-19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety and changes in alcohol drinking, gambling behavior and problem gambling in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown. This web survey included athletes in top leagues of soccer, ice hockey and handball in Sweden (N = 327, 62% men). A total of 66% and 51% were worried about the future of their sport or about their own future in sports, respectively. Feeling worse psychologically during the pandemic was common (72% of women, 40% of men, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); depression criteria were endorsed by 19% of women and three percent of men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); anxiety criteria by 20% of women and five percent of men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Reporting increased gambling during the pandemic was associated with gambling problem severity. Moderate-risk or problem gambling was seen in 10% of men and none of the women (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Depression and anxiety were associated with feeling worse during the COVID-19 pandemic and with concern over one's own sports future. In conclusion, COVID-19-related distress is common in elite athletes and associated with mental health symptoms.

The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 2,452 abstracts and identified 491 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence.

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic?</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND FINDINGS"">We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3%-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%-37%, prediction interval 24%-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.</AbstractText>",Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A living systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Journal Article|Meta-Analysis|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Systematic Review", ,"Asymptomatic Diseases|Asymptomatic Infections|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Disease Progression|Humans|Mass Screening|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-10-01,PLoS medicine,NCT04742569,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960881,NA

METHODOLOGY: Analytical study in which we correlated secondary data obtained from reports of the Ministry of Health and National Institute for Statistics and Informatic. The cumulative incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in 25 peruvian regions is reported, together with its relationnship with altitude levels during March-July 2020 using PearsoÅ„s correlation. We also aiming to assess the prevalence of diabetes, obesity and hypertension with altitude according to the ENDES 2018 data using Gamma statistics. RESULTS: COVID-19 maintained an inverse correlation with higher rates in the coastal regions and lower rates with increasing altitude in the cumulative incidence (PearsonÂ =Â -0.8, pÂ &lt;Â 0.000) and mortality (PearsonÂ =Â -0.77, pÂ &lt;Â 0.000), adjusted gender and age.

32991844,"<AbstractText>Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection and identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49Â days, nAb titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (nâ€‰=â€‰54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever â‰¥38Â°C and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (nâ€‰=â€‰116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

33125914,"<AbstractText>The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally. An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, ""Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?""</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients taking statins were 11â€‰years older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients who were not taking statins. A genetic matching (GM) procedure was performed prior to analysis of the mortality risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the cause-specific hazard (CSH) function, and a competing-risks Fine and Gray (FG) model was also used to study the direct effects of statins on risk.Data from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed 2157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1234 men, 923 women; age: 67â€‰y/o (IQR 54-78)) admitted to the hospital were retrieved from the clinical records in anonymized manner. 353 deaths occurred. 581 patients were taking statins. Univariate test after GM showed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients on statin therapy than the matched non-statin group (19.8% vs. 25.4%, Ï‡2 with Yates continuity correction: pâ€‰=â€‰0.027). The mortality rate was even lower in patients (nâ€‰=â€‰336) who maintained their statin treatments during hospitalization compared to the GM non-statin group (17.4%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.045). The Cox model applied to the CSH function (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.58(CI: 0.39-0.89); pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and the competing risks FG model (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.60(CI: 0.39-0.92); pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) suggest that statins are associated with reduced COVID-19-related mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">A lower SARS-CoV-2 infection-related mortality was observed in patients treated with statin therapy prior to hospitalization.

33146320,"<AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread exponentially across the world. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, headache and fatigue. However, atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported. Recently, a number of studies have recognized various mucocutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This study sought to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of the potential orofacial manifestations of COVID-19. An online literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to retrieve the relevant studies published up to July 2020. Original studies published in English that reported orofacial manifestations in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included; this yielded 16 articles involving 25 COVID-19-positive patients. The results showed a marked heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations. The most common orofacial manifestations were ulcerative lesions, vesiculobullous/macular lesions, and acute sialadentitis of the parotid gland (parotitis). In four cases, oral manifestations were the first signs of COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 may cause orofacial manifestations that might be the initial features in several cases. However, the occurrence of orofacial manifestations in COVID-19 seems to be underreported, mainly due to the lack of oral examination of patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19. Oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases is crucial for better understanding and documenting COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations.</AbstractText>",Orofacial manifestations of COVID-19: a brief review of the published literature.,Journal Article|Review, ,"Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|NA",2020-11-09,Brazilian oral research,NCT04821986,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146320,NA

The mechanisms of innate immunity, considered as the first line of antiviral defense, is essential towards viruses. A significant role in host defense of the lung, nasal and oral cavities is played by Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) HE4 has been demonstrated to be serum inflammatory biomarker and to show a role in natural immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract with both antimicrobial/antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Several biomarkers like IL-6, presepsin (PSP), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, D-Dimer have showed a good function as predictor factors for the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients (mild, severe and critical). The aim of this study was to correlate the blood levels of CRP, IL-6, PSP, PCT, D-Dimer with He4, to identify the predictive values of these biomarkers for the evolution of the disease and to evaluate the possible role of HE4 in the defense mechanisms of innate immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of Policlinico-University of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6 Â± 12.4 and 28 women age 65.7 Â± 15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4 Â± 7.7 and 6 women age 74.8 Â± 6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (<i>r</i> = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (<i>r</i> = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (<i>r</i> = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (<i>r</i> = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (<i>r</i> = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.</AbstractText>",New Insights in Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 Patients: Looking for the Role and Predictive Value of <i>Human epididymis secretory protein 4</i> (HE4) and the Innate Immunity of the Oral Cavity and Respiratory Tract.,Journal Article, , ,2020-11-28,Microorganisms,NCT04840940,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33147871,NA

Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged â‰¥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2Â·2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3Â·5-6Â·5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged â‰¥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20â€ˆ713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13â€ˆ898-33â€ˆ550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16â€ˆ170 AU/mL [10â€ˆ233-40â€ˆ353], n=26; and â‰¥70 years 17â€ˆ561 AU/mL [9705-37â€ˆ796], n=47; p=0Â·68).

33299095,"<AbstractText>Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV) are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices, which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore, mobile applications that accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on 2745 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 to September 11, 2020, consisting of PCR positive tests conducted between February 16 and September 9. Considering male (female) participants, 11.9% (11.2%) of the participants were asymptomatic, 48.3% (47.8%) recovered at home by themselves, 29.7% (33.7%) recovered at home with the help of someone else, 9.3% (6.6%) required hospitalization without ventilation, and 0.5% (0.4%) required ventilation. There were a total of 21 symptoms reported, and the prevalence of symptoms varies by sex. Fever was present in 59.4% of male subjects and in 52% of female subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.82â€‰Â±â€‰0.017 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77â€‰Â±â€‰0.018 for the prediction of illness on a specific day. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while HRV is decreased. Measuring these metrics, taken in conjunction with molecular-based diagnostics, may lead to better early detection and monitoring of COVID-19.</AbstractText>",Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices.,Journal Article, , ,2020-12-13,NPJ digital medicine,NCT04742569,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33299095,NA

Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1â€ˆ-â€ˆrelative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age.

33322316,"<AbstractText>An increasing number of young and previously fit and healthy people who did not require hospitalisation continue to have symptoms months after mild cases of COVID-19. Rehabilitation clinics are already offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome based on the claims that it is effective for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)-the most common post-infectious syndrome-as no study into the efficacy of CBT for post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome has been published. Re-analyses of these studies, however, showed that CBT did not lead to objective improvements in heterogeneous groups of ME/CFS patients, nor did it restore the ability to work. The group of patients with long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, on the other hand, is homogeneous. We therefore analysed the Dutch Qure study, as it studied the efficacy of CBT in a homogeneous group of patients who developed Q-fever fatigue syndrome-which affects up to 30% of patients-after the largest reported outbreak of Q-fever, to see if CBT might potentially be an effective treatment for long-haulers after COVID-19 infection. Our reanalysis found that the Qure study suffered from many serious methodological problems, which included relying on one subjective primary outcome in a study without a control group for the non-blinded CBT treatment group, using a post hoc definition of improvement, waiting 2 years before publishing their objective actometer results and ignoring the null effect of said results. Moreover, only 10% of participants achieved a clinically meaningful subjective improvement in fatigue as a result of CBT according to the study's own figures. Consequently, CBT has no subjective clinically meaningful effect in nine out of every ten patients that are treated with it. Additionally, the subjective improvement in fatigue was not matched by an improvement in disability, even though the disability was fatigue related according to the researchers. On top of this, CBT did not lead to an objective improvement in physical performance. Therefore, it cannot be said that CBT is an effective treatment for Q-fever fatigue syndrome either. It seems therefore unlikely that CBT will reduce disability or lead to objective improvement in long COVID or in post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome.</AbstractText>",Could Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Be an Effective Treatment for Long COVID and Post COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome?

33364250,"<AbstractText>This paper focuses on the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the dietary habits of adult Danes. Two aspects were specifically considered: 1) reported changes in intake of specific food categories and 2) effect on healthy eating, operationalized as adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS score). Respondents (<i>N</i> = 2,462) completed a 44-items self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of their socio-demographic characteristics, general food habits, and consumption frequency of selected foods (mainly related to the MedDiet) during the lockdown. The data indicated that the lockdown has affected dietary habits of adult Danes to a relatively limited degree. The most important findings were that a substantial proportion of respondents (â‰¥28%) reported eating more, snacking more, exercising less, and gaining weight during the lockdown. Results could be linked to the amount of time spent at home (e.g., a higher cooking frequency) a higher degree of emotional eating during the lockdown (e.g., a higher consumption of pastries and alcohol). Women were generally affected to a higher degree than men. Additionally, dietary changes during the lockdown to a certain degree reflected pre-existing (un)healthy eating habits, as positive health outcomes were observed in respondents with a high MEDAS score and negative outcomes (e.g., weight gain and higher intakes of pastries and carbonated beverages) were associated with respondents with a low MEDAS score. These changes, if sustained long-term, are potentially concerning from a public health perspective, especially given that more than half of the respondents were characterized by a low adherence to the MedDiet.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Giacalone, FrÃ¸st and RodrÃ­guez-PÃ©rez.</CopyrightInformation>",Reported Changes in Dietary Habits During the COVID-19 Lockdown in the Danish Population: The Danish COVIDiet Study.,Journal Article, , ,2020-12-29,Frontiers in nutrition,NCT04449731,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33364250,NA

33403997,"<AbstractText>Persistence of symptoms or development of new symptoms relating to SARS-CoV-2 infection late in the course of COVID-19 is an increasingly recognised problem facing the globally infected population and its health systems. 'Long-COVID' or 'COVID long-haulers' generally describes those persons with COVID-19 who experience symptoms for &amp;gt;28 days after diagnosis, whether laboratory confirmed or clinical. Symptoms are as markedly heterogeneous as seen in acute COVID-19 and may be constant, fluctuate, or appear and be replaced by symptoms relating to other systems with varying frequency. Such multisystem involvement requires a holistic approach to management of long-COVID, and descriptions of cohorts from low- and middle-income countries are eagerly awaited. Although many persons with long-COVID will be managed in primary care, others will require greater input from rehabilitation medicine experts. For both eventualities, planning is urgently required to ensure that the South African public health service is ready and able to respond.</AbstractText>",Long-COVID: An evolving problem with an extensive impact.,Journal Article, ,Age Factors|Anosmia|COVID-19|Cognitive Dysfunction|Comorbidity|Dyspnea|Fatigue|Headache|Health Planning|Humans|Obesity|Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|Primary Health Care|Recovery of Function|Risk Assessment|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index|Sex Factors|South Africa|Time Factors|NA,2021-01-15,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,NCT04987853,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403997,NA

Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 212 to 354), regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 96% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 15, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells.

33521007,"<AbstractText>Different viral agents, such as herpesviruses, human papillomavirus, and Coxsackie virus, are responsible for primary oral lesions, while other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, affect the oral cavity due to immune system weakness. Interestingly, it has been reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can show cutaneous manifestations, including the oral cavity. However, the association between oral injuries and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still unclear. This narrative review aimed to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of oral lesions associated with COVID-19. An online literature search was conducted to select relevant studies published up to November 2020. The results of 17 studies showed variability in oral lesions associated with COVID-19, including ulcerations, aphthous-like lesions, and macules. The tongue, lips, and palate were the most frequent anatomical locations. According to current knowledge, the etiopathogenesis of multiple COVID-19-associated lesions seems to be multifactorial. The appearance of such lesions could be related to the direct or indirect action of SARS-CoV-2 over the oral mucosa cells, coinfections, immunity impairment, and adverse drug reactions. Nevertheless, COVID-19-associated oral lesions may be underreported, mainly due to lockdown periods and the lack of mandatory dispositive protection. Consequently, further research is necessary to determine the diagnostic and pathological significance of oral manifestations of COVID-19. All medical doctors, dentists, and dermatologists are encouraged to perform an accurate and thorough oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to recognize the disease's possible early manifestations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 La Rosa, Libra, De Pasquale, Ferlito and PedullÃ .</CopyrightInformation>",Association of Viral Infections With Oral Cavity Lesions: Role of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,Journal Article|Review, , ,2021-02-02,Frontiers in medicine,NCT04821986,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33521007,NA

Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p&lt;0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p&lt;0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM<sup>+</sup> (p=not significant).

SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were assessed in a cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons from April 16 to December 31, 2020 with a PCR-positive swab â‰¥14 days after the first-positive antibody test were investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those who were antibody-negative.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Findings"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab â‰¥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0-45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22-14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1-96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Interpretation"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Reinfection is rare in the young and international population of Qatar.

We used latent class analysis independently in each cohort to identify subphenotypes based on clinical and laboratory variables. We then analyzed the associations of subphenotypes with 28-day mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Latent class analysis identified four subphenotypes (SP) with consistent characteristics across the discovery (45 centers; nÂ = 2,188) and replication (22 centers; nÂ = 1,112) cohorts. SP1 was characterized by shock, acidemia, and multiorgan dysfunction, including acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy. SP2 was characterized by high C-reactive protein, early need for mechanical ventilation, and the highest rate of ARDS. SP3 showed the highest burden of chronic diseases, whereas SP4 demonstrated limited chronic disease burden and mild physiologic abnormalities. Twenty-eight-day mortality in the discovery cohort ranged from 20.6%Â (SP4) to 52.9%Â (SP1). Mortality across subphenotypes remained different after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction and illness severity, regional and hospital factors. Compared with SP4, the relative risks were as follows: SP1, 1.67 (95%Â CI, 1.36-2.03); SP2, 1.39 (95%Â CI, 1.17-1.65); and SP3, 1.39 (95%Â CI, 1.15-1.67).

Secondary outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), thrombotic events, and seven blood markers of inflammation and thrombosis. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models were used.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Among the 4,908 study patients, mean (SD) age was 60.9 (14.7) years, 3,095 (62.8%) were male, and 2,552 (52.0%) had obesity. In multivariable models, BMI was not associated with mortality. Higher BMI beginning at 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT but not thrombosis. There was no clinically significant association between BMI and inflammatory or thrombotic markers.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In critically ill patients with COVID-19, higher BMI was not associated with death or thrombotic events but was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT. The lack of an association between BMI and circulating biomarkers calls into question the paradigm that obesity contributes to poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 by upregulating systemic inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 The Obesity Society.</CopyrightInformation>","Obesity, inflammatory and thrombotic markers, and major clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the US.",Journal Article, , ,2021-09-24,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",NCT04343898,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34109768,NA

All patients were evaluated using the same standardized questionnaire assessing motor and NMS (including a list of most disabling, new or worsened symptoms and Patient's Global Impression-Improvement scales [PGI-I]) psycho-social queries and quality of life.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">2653 PwP were included: 441 (16.6%) in the PEC group and 2122 (83.4%) in the community-based group. Physiotherapy was interrupted among 88.6% of the patients. 40.9% referred a clinical modification of their symptoms. Based on the questionnaire, pain (9.3%), rigidity (9.1%) and tremor (8.5%) were the three most frequently new or worsened reported symptoms. Based on the PGI-I, the motor symptoms were the most affected domain, followed by pain and psychic state. PwP in community-based group tended to have more frequent worsening for motor symptoms, motor complications, pain and confusion than those of the PEC group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The first COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on motor and NMS of PwP.

Median duration of hospitalisation was 15 days (interquartile range [IQR] 10&amp;ndash;24) with 24 days (IQR 14&amp;ndash;32) in ICU patients and 10 days (IQR 7&amp;ndash;15) in non-ICU patients. At day 90, 41 of 44 survivors (93%) were outpatients. No long-term adverse events or late-onset infections were identified after acute hospital care. High SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres were found in all but one patient, who was pretreated with rituximab. Pulmonary function tests showed no obstructive patterns, but restrictive patterns in two (5.7%) and impaired diffusion capacities for carbon monoxide in 11 (31%) of 35 patients, which predominated in prior ICU patients. Twenty-one of 35 (60%) CT-scans at day 90 showed residual abnormalities, with similar distributions between prior ICU and non-ICU patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In this cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, no tocilizumab-related long-term adverse events or late-onset infections were identified.
