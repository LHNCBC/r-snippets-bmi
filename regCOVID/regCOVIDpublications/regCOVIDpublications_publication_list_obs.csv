The effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting to the hospital with surgical complaints remain uncertain. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A single tertiary center retrospective study analysis compared the ED attendance rate and severity of patients with surgical complaints between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2019 and 2018. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall, 6,017 patients were included. The mean daily ED visits of patients with nontrauma surgical complaints in the COVID-19 outbreak period declined by 27%-32% (<i>P</i> value &lt;.01) compared with pre-COVID-19 periods. The log number of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Israel in March 2020 was negatively correlated with the number of ED visits (Pearson's <i>r</i>â€‰=â€‰-0.59, <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01). The proportion of patients requiring hospitalization increased by up to 8% during the outbreak period (<i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01), and there was a higher proportion of tachycardic patients (20% versus 15.5%, <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰.01). The percentage of visits to the ED by men declined by 5% (<i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01). The ED diagnosis distribution significantly changed during COVID-19 (<i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰.013), with an 84% decrease in the number of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease (<i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.05). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> During the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall number of patients presenting at the ED with surgical complaints decreased significantly, and there was a higher admissions ratio. The extent to which the pandemic affects hospital ED attendance can help health care professionals prepare for future such events.

Thereafter, for each symptom and for combinations of the symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and areas under the curve (AUCs) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the occurrence of COVID-19-like infection in the nontested population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 171,310 people responded to the survey, of whom 102,543 (59.9%) were women; mean age 47.4 years. Out of the 4785 respondents with known NPS test results, 4392 were not hospitalized. Among the 4392 nonhospitalized respondents, those with positive NPS tests (856, 19.5%) most frequently reported myalgia (527, 61.6%), olfactory and taste disorders (507, 59.2%), cough (466, 54.4%), and fever (444, 51.9%), whereas 7.7% were asymptomatic. Multiple regression analysis showed that olfactory and taste disorders (aOR 10.3, 95% CI 8.4-12.7), fever (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.1), myalgia (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and cough (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with NPS positivity. Having two to four of these symptoms increased the aOR from 7.4 (95% CI 5.6-9.7) to 35.5 (95% CI 24.6-52.2). The combination of the four symptoms showed an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI 0.795-0.825) in classifying positive NPS test results and then was applied to the nonhospitalized and nontested sample (n=165,782).

Glucose uptake is correlated with anÂ increased anaerobic glycolysis seen in activated inflammatory cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. The aim of the study was to assess the inflammatory status at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in non-critically ill patients requiring admission for COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Patients admitted with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. FDG PET/CT was performed from day 6 to day 14 of the onset of symptoms. Depending on FDG PET/CT findings, patients' profiles were classified as ""inflammatory"" or ""low inflammatory."" FDG PET/CT data were compared with chest CT evolution and short-term clinical outcome. All inflammatory sites were reported to screen potential extra-pulmonary tropism.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Thirteen patients were included. Maximum standardized uptake values ranged from 4.7 to 16.3 in lungs. All patients demonstrated increased mediastinal lymph nodes glucose uptake. Three patients (23%) presented mild nasopharyngeal, two patients (15%) bone marrow, and five patients (38%) splenic mild increase in glucose uptake. No patient had significant digestive focal or segmental glucose uptake. There was no significant physiological myocardial glucose uptake in all patients except one. There was no correlation between PET lung inflammatory status and chest CTÂ evolution or short-term clinical outcome.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Inflammatory process at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in COVID-19 patients is obvious in FDG PET/CT scans.

These mediators are transcriptionally regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules.METHODSWe treated a group of patients (n = 20) with baricitinib according to an off-label use of the drug. The study was designed as an observational, longitudinal trial and approved by the local ethics committee. The patients were treated with 4 mg baricitinib twice daily for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for the remaining 7 days. Changes in the immune phenotype and expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in blood cells were evaluated and correlated with serum-derived cytokine levels and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2). In a single treated patient, we also evaluated the alteration of myeloid cell functional activity.RESULTSWe provide evidence that patients treated with baricitinib had a marked reduction in serum levels of IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î±, a rapid recovery of circulating T and B cell frequencies, and increased antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, all of which were clinically associated with a reduction in the need for oxygen therapy and a progressive increase in the P/F (PaO2, oxygen partial pressure/FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio.CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that baricitinib prevented the progression to a severe, extreme form of the viral disease by modulating the patients' immune landscape and that these changes were associated with a safer, more favorable clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04438629.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Fondazione Cariverona (ENACT Project) and the Fondazione TIM.</AbstractText>",NCT04438629,Abstract,3/26/2020,6/10/2020,Observational,Evaluation of Immune Response in COVID-19 Patients,Recruiting,NA,Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata Verona,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04438629,1,0,1,0,NA,Italy,0,1,COVID-19 treatment,0,245,0.9860039988574693,0.5,0,1.4860039988574694

This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3-fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in Î³Î´ T cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.

As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to the following: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Within the sample, 7.9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Depression scores were associated with increased time spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b=-0.07, t[863]=-2.04, P=.04). Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumors, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b=-0.05, t[863]=-2.13, P=.03). Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the amount of time spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium for disseminating pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly.

An Observational Study.,2021-01-13,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,"<AbstractText><b>Rationale:</b> Patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have complex organ support needs that necessitate prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), likely to result in a high incidence of neuromuscular weakness and loss of well-being. Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations.<b>Objectives:</b> To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation, and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19.<b>Methods:</b> Adults admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for &gt;24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score to identify the time taken to first mobilize (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge.<b>Results:</b> A total of <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰177 patients were identified, of whom <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. While on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19â€‰Â±â€‰10 d), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard deviation time to first mobilize was 14â€‰Â±â€‰7 days, with a median Manchester Mobility Score at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4-6), which represents participants able to stand and step around to a chair with or without assistance.

This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID-19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID-19 infections. Methods and Results In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D-dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. Conclusions We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID-19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID-19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronaviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.TRIAL REGISTRATIONCOVID-19 Patients Characterization, Biobank, Treatment Response and Outcome Predictor (COVID-BioB).

Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19-related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD Â± 12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19-related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.27-6.36; p &lt; 0.001) compared with those with taste loss.

These patients show great complexity due to multiple organ involvement and a dynamic evolution over time; moreover, few information is available about the risk factors that may contribute to increase the time course of mechanical ventilation.The primary objective of this study is to investigate the risk factors associated with the inability to liberate COVID-19 patients from mechanical ventilation. Due to the complex evolution of the disease, we analyzed both pulmonary variables and occurrence of non-pulmonary complications during mechanical ventilation.

Global air travel offers an easy and fast opportunity not only for people but also for infectious diseases to spread around the world within a few days. Also, large public events facilitate increasing infection numbers. Therefore, rapid on-site screening for infected people is urgently needed. Due to the small size and easy handling, ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is a very promising, sensitive method for the on-site identification of infectious pathogens based on scents, representing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether identification of Influenza-A-infection based on VOCs by MCC-IMS is possible in breath. Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive persons with and without Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Four healthy staff members and six patients with negative PCR result served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from those not infected with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept-study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 min by MCC-IMS. The next step is to validate the results with a greater number of patients with Influenza-A-infection as well as other viral diseases, especially COVID-19.

COVID-19 patients aged 65 to 84 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.50), needing mechanical ventilation (OR 8.74, 95% CI 5.27 to 14.77), having congestive cardiac failure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.50), chronic liver disease (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.00), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.97 to 4.01) had higher odds for developing AKI. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 AKI versus COVID-19 patients without AKI (60.5% versus 27.4%, p &lt; 0.001), and AKI was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.39 to 4.48). Compared with AKI controls, COVID-19 AKI was observed in a higher proportion of men (58.9% versus 51%, p = 0.04) and lower proportion with white ethnicity (74.7% versus 86.9%, p = 0.003); was more frequently associated with cerebrovascular disease (11.8% versus 6.0%, p = 0.006), chronic lung disease (28.0% versus 19.3%, p = 0.007), diabetes (24.7% versus 17.9%, p = 0.03), and CKD (34.2% versus 20.0%, p &lt; 0.001); and was more likely to be hospital acquired (61.2% versus 46.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Mortality was higher in the COVID-19 AKI as compared to the control AKI group (60.5% versus 27.6%, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AKI patients aged 65 to 84 years, (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.35) and â‰¥85 years of age (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.87 to 6.70), peak AKI stage 2 (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.90), AKI stage 3 (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.57), and COVID-19 (OR 3.80, 95% CI 2.62 to 5.51) had higher odds of death. Limitations of the study include retrospective design, lack of urinalysis data, and low ethnic diversity of the region.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We observed a high incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 that was associated with a 3-fold higher odds of death than COVID-19 without AKI and a 4-fold higher odds of death than AKI due to other causes.

Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study.

Median respiratory system compliance was 31Â·9 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O (26Â·0-39Â·9). Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28. Predictors of 28-day mortality were gender, age, tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, arterial pH, and heart rate on the first day of invasive ventilation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">In patients with COVID-19 who were invasively ventilated during the first month of the outbreak in the Netherlands, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and low driving pressure was broadly applied and prone positioning was often used. The applied PEEP varied widely, despite an invariably low respiratory system compliance. The findings of this national study provide a basis for new hypotheses and sample size calculations for future trials of invasive ventilation for COVID-19. These data could also help in the interpretation of findings from other studies of ventilation practice and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location Academic Medical Center.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score were 17 (interquartile range, 11-21) and 8 (interquartile range, 7-9), respectively. Anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke represented 93.5% of cases. The rate modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 was 79.6% (74 patients [95% CI, 71.3-87.8]). Thirty-day mortality was 29% (27 patients [95% CI, 20-39.4]). Early neurological improvement was 19.5% (17 patients [95% CI, 11.8-29.5]), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 5.4% (5 patients [95% CI, 1.7-12.1]). Patients who died at 30 days exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count, higher levels of aspartate, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). After adjustment for age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and successful reperfusion, these biological markers remained associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 [95% CI, 1.21-5.98] per SD-log decrease in lymphocyte count, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.22-5.77] per SD-log increase in aspartate, and 4.30 [95% CI, 1.43-12.91] per SD-log increase in LDH).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The 29% rate of 30-day mortality after MT among patients with COVID-19 is not negligible.

Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P&lt;.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04645563; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04645563.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Ramazan SabÄ±rlÄ±, Emre Karsli, Omer Canacik, Dogan Ercin, Handan Ã‡iftÃ§i, Levent Sahin, Turgut Dolanbay, Emin Ediz Tutuncu.

There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was effective in murine influenza pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">Our innovative design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1-7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">This study has core institution approval (UBC Providence Healthcare Research Ethics Board) and site institution approvals (Health Research Ethics Board, University of Alberta; Comite d'etique de la recerche, CHU Sainte Justine (for McGill University and University of Sherbrook); Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, University of Calgary; Queen's University Health Sciences &amp; Affiliated Hospitals Research Ethics Board; Research Ethics Board, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; Veritas Independent Research Board (for Humber River Hospital); Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board; Unity Health Toronto Research Ethics Board, St. Michael's Hospital).

This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity.

Its high infection rate and rapid spread contribute to set the risk for relevant psychological stress in citizens. In this context, mother-infant health is at risk not only because of potential direct exposure to the virus but also due to high levels of stress experienced by mothers from conception to delivery. Prenatal stress exposure associates with less-than-optimal child developmental outcomes, and specific epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA methylation) may play a critical role in mediating this programming association.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">We present the methodological protocol for a longitudinal, multicentric study on the behavioural and epigenetic effects of COVID-19-related prenatal stress in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Northern Italy.

Saliva samples will be collected at birth to assess the methylation status of specific genes linked with stress regulation in mothers and newborns. Mothers will provide retrospective data on COVID-19-related stress during pregnancy.

Data retrieved for this study included patient sociodemographic data, baseline comorbidities, baseline treatments, other background data on care provided in hospital or primary care settings, and vital status. Main outcome was deaths until June 29, 2020. In the multivariable model based on nursing home residents, predictors of mortality were being male, older than 80Â years, admitted to a hospital for COVID-19, and having cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or dementia while taking anticoagulants or lipid-lowering drugs at baseline was protective. The AUC was 0.754 for the risk score based on this model and 0.717 in the validation subsample. Predictors of death among people from the general population were being male and/or older than 60Â years, having been hospitalized in the month before admission for COVID-19, being admitted to a hospital for COVID-19, having cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory disease, liver disease, diabetes with organ damage, or cancer while being on anticoagulants was protective.

Healthcare professionals are heavily affected by this rapidly changing situation, especially frontline healthcare professionals who are directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 and may experience psychological burdens. The objective of this study is to explore the evolution of psychosocial, cardiovascular, and immune markers in healthcare professionals with different levels of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods and Analysis:</b> This is a STROBE compliant, blended, exploratory study involving online and onsite approaches that use wearable monitoring. A planned random probability sample of residents, staff physicians, nurses, and auxiliary healthcare professionals will be recruited. The study sample will be stratified by exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a first step, recruitment will be conducted online, with e-consent and using e-surveys with Maslach Burnout Inventory, Fuster-BEWAT score, and sociodemographic characteristics. Onsite visits will be planned for the second step where participants will receive a wearable setup that will measure heart rate, actimetry, and sleep quality monitoring, which will be used together with blood sampling for immune biomarkers. Steps 1 and 2 will then be repeated at 2-3 months, and 6 months. Power BI and Tableau will be used for data visualization, while front-end data capture will be used for data collection using specific survey/questionnaires, which will enable data linkage between e-surveys, internet of things wearable devices, and clinical laboratory data. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT04422418.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Al Tunaiji, Al Qubaisi, Dalkilinc, Campos, Ugwuoke, Alefishat, Aloum, Ross, Almahmeed and Baltatu.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04422418,Abstract,7/1/2020,12/14/2020,Observational,Impact of Burnout on Cardiovascular and Immune Biomarkers in Healthcare Professionals - Covid-19 Pandemic in Abu Dhabi,Recruiting,NA,Khalifa University for Science and Technology,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04422418,1,0,1,0,NA,United Arab Emirates,0,1,NA,0,217,0.9876035418451871,0.5,0,1.487603541845187

Identification of COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who might develop into severe or critical illness is essential to save lives. We conducted an observational study in a dedicated make-shift hospital for adult male COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms between February and March 2020. Baseline characteristics, medical history, and clinical presentation were recorded. Laboratory tests and chest computed tomography were performed. Patients were observed until they were either transferred to a hospital for advanced care owing to disease exacerbation or were discharged after improvement. Patients were grouped based on their chest imaging findings or short-term outcomes. A total of 125 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled. Of these, 7 patients were transferred for advanced care while 118 patients were discharged after improvement and showed no disease recurrence during an additional 28-day follow-up period. Eighty-five patients (68.0%) had abnormal chest imaging findings. Patients with abnormal chest imaging findings were more likely to have disease deterioration and require advanced care as compared to those with normal chest imaging findings. Patients with deteriorated outcomes were more likely to have low peripheral blood oxygen saturation and moderately-elevated body temperature. There were no significant differences between patients with deteriorated or improved outcomes with respect to age, comorbidities, or other clinical symptoms (including nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea). Abnormal chest imaging findings, low peripheral blood oxygen saturation, and elevated temperature were associated with disease deterioration in adult male COVID-19 patients with mild clinical symptoms. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/SelectProtocol?sid=S0009RA3&amp;selectaction=Edit&amp;uid=U0003F4L&amp;ts=2&amp;cx=-ajpsbw, identifier NCT04346602.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Yan, Song, Guo, Wang, Peng and Li.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04346602,Abstract,2/1/2020,6/1/2020,Observational,A Study on the Clinical and Psychological Characteristics of Patients With COVID-2019,Recruiting,NA,Jilin University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04346602,1,0,1,0,NA,China,0,0,all treatment about COVID-2019,0,206,0.988231933733219,0,0,0.988231933733219

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","<AbstractText>Profound T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL) dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older COVID-19 patients, we hypothesize, are, therefore, at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting (SB) of the terminal restriction fragments in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87 Â± 8 (mean Â± SD) and 87 Â± 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields 2 key metrics: the proportions of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %) and their mean (TeSLA mTL), (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 Â± 0.42 in COVID-19 patients and 1.50 Â± 0.50 in non-COVID-19 patients (p &lt; .001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (p = .005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (p = .03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to COVID-19 lymphopenia among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.

To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954 ). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that there were 4.8 (95% CI: 2.8-6.8) undiagnosed cases for every diagnosed case of COVID-19 during this same time period in the United States, and an estimated 16.8 million undiagnosed cases by mid-July 2020.</AbstractText>",NCT04334954,Abstract,8/26/2020,3/31/2022,Observational,SARS-COV2 Pandemic Serosurvey and Blood Sampling,"Active, not recruiting",NA,National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334954,1,0,1,1,82947652,United States,0,103,NA,0,39,0.9977720651242502,1,0,2.9977720651242503

This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologicals, ciclosporin, or tofacitinib in the COVID-19 pandemic period cohort than in the historical control period cohort (177 [46%] of 387 patients in the COVID-19 cohort vs 134 [36%] of 373 patients in the historical cohort; p=0Â·0064).

Venovenous ECMO was adopted in 122 patients (92.4%) and venoarterial ECMO in ten patients (7.6%) (mean duration, 14.6 Â± 11.0 days). Sixty-three (47.7%) patients died on ECMO and 70 (53.0%) during the index hospitalization. Six-month all-cause mortality was 53.0%. Advanced age (per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.026, 95% CI 1.000-1-052) and low arterial pH (per unit, HR 0.006, 95% CI 0.000-0.083) before ECMO were the only baseline variables associated with increased risk of six-month mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The present findings suggested that about half of adult patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS can be managed successfully with ECMO with sustained results at six months.

The participants were categorized as modified high-risk (mHR), or low-risk (mLR)-OSA according to a modified version of the Berlin questionnaire. Snoring patterns (intensity and/or frequency), breathing pauses and morning/daytime sleepiness, without taking obesity and hypertension into account, were used in the regression models. <b>Results:</b> The primary outcome was clinical improvement defined as a decline of 2 categories from admission on a 7-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included worsening (increase of 1 category), need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen and intensive care. In total, 320 eligible patients were enrolled. According to the modified scoring, 70 (21.9%) had mHR-OSA. Among 242 patients requiring hospitalization, clinical improvement within 2 weeks occurred in 75.4 % of the mHR-OSA group compared to 88.4 % of the modified low-risk (mLR-OSA) group (P = 0.014).

SARS-CoV-2 has been found in cardiac tissue, and myocardial dysfunction post-COVID-19 may occur. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and cardiovascular biomarkers remains unknown. Methods and Results COVID MECH (COVID-19 Mechanisms) was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 patients (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60Â±15Â (mean Â± SD) years, 71 (58%) were men, 68 (55%) were White, and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently men, had more diabetes mellitus, and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin (all &lt;0.001), but comparable levels of cTnT (cardiac troponin T; <i>P</i>=0.09), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; <i>P</i>=0.27) and D-dimer (<i>P</i>=0.67) to patients without viremia. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in plasma at either baseline or day 3 in 50 (52%) patients, and these patients experienced increase from baseline to day 3 in NT-proBNP and D-dimer concentrations, while there was no change in cTnT. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 viremia was associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory, but not cardiovascular biomarkers. NT-proBNP and D-dimer, but not cTnT, increased from baseline to day 3 in patients with viremia.

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period.

The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6â€‰months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques.

In this study, we investigated whether measurement of lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide (DL<sub>NO</sub> ) offers additional insights on the presence and mechanisms of gas transport abnormalities. In 94 subjects, recovering from mild-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, we measured DL<sub>NO</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub> between 10 and 266Â days after each patient was tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In 38 subjects, a chest computed tomography (CT) was available for semiquantitative analysis at six axial levels and automatic quantitative analysis of entire lungs. DL<sub>NO</sub> was abnormal in 57% of subjects, independent of time of lung function testing and severity of COVID-19, whereas standard DL<sub>CO</sub> was reduced in only 20% and mostly within the first 3Â months. These differences were not associated with changes of simultaneous DL<sub>NO</sub> /DL<sub>CO</sub> ratio, while DL<sub>CO</sub> /V<sub>A</sub> and DL<sub>NO</sub> /V<sub>A</sub> were within normal range or slightly decreased. DL<sub>CO</sub> but not DL<sub>NO</sub> positively correlated with recovery time and DL<sub>CO</sub> was within the normal range in about 90% of cases after 3Â months, while DL<sub>NO</sub> was reduced in more than half of subjects. Both DL<sub>NO</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub> inversely correlated with persisting CT ground glass opacities and mean lung attenuation, but these were more frequently associated with DL<sub>NO</sub> than DL<sub>CO</sub> decrease. These data show that an impairment of DL<sub>NO</sub> exceeding standard DL<sub>CO</sub> may be present during the recovery from COVID-19, possibly due to loss of alveolar units with alveolar membrane damage, but relatively preserved capillary volume. Alterations of gas transport may be present even in subjects who had mild COVID-19 pneumonia and no or minimal persisting CT abnormalities.

C-reactive protein, time to oxygen mask failure, age, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> during CPAP, number of comorbidities were independently associated with CPAP failure. Helmet CPAP was maintained for 6 [3-9] days, almost continuously during the first two days. None of the full treatment patients died before intubation in the wards.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Helmet CPAP treatment is feasible for several days outside the ICU, despite persistent impairment in gas exchange. It was used, without escalating to intubation, in the majority of full treatment patients after standard oxygen therapy failed.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 among United States (US) dental hygienists, describe infection prevention and control procedures and any associated trends in mental health.<b>Methods:</b> Registered dental hygienists (RDHs) licensed in the US were invited to participate in a 30-question web-based survey. COVID-19 infection items included probable and confirmed results, COVID-19 related symptoms experienced in the last month, and level of concern about COVID-19 transmission to patients and themselves. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire 4 screened respondents for depression or anxiety. Personal protective equipment (PPE) use when treating patients was assessed. The research protocol and survey were approved by the American Dental Association IRB and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04542915). Kruskal-Wallis and X<sup>2</sup> tests were used to test for associations between PPE use, PPE supply, mental health symptoms, and concern about COVID-19 transmission.<b>Results:</b> As of October 8, 2020, a total of 4,776 dental hygienists from all 50 states and Puerto Rico participated in the study. Respondents reported elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. Of the respondents, 3.1% (n=149) had ever tested positive or been diagnosed with COVID-19. The majority of respondents (99.1%; n=3,328) who practiced dental hygiene reported their primary dental practice had enhanced infection prevention or control efforts in response to the pandemic. PPE use was significantly associated with years of experience as a dental hygienist, level of concern about COVID-19, and level of PPE supplies available (<i>p</i>-values&lt;0.01), but not type of dental practice (<i>p</i>-value 0.1).<b>Conclusion:</b> As of October 2020, the estimated prevalence rate of dental hygienists in the US having had COVID-19 was low.

The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04502108; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04502108.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Jan Taeymans, Eefje Luijckx, Slavko Rogan, Karin Haas, Heiner Baur.

Determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by rRT-PCR sometimes results in an inconclusive test result due to a high cycle threshold-value. We retrospectively analyzed 30,851 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test results. Borderline positivity was considered as the presence of â‰¤25 viral copies per milliliter, while no amplification was considered as a negative test result. Of all test results, 204 were answered as borderline, of which 107 were accompanied by a follow-up test within 96 hours. Of the 107 follow-up samples, 10 (9.35%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 symptoms were not predictive for testing positive in the follow-up test.

Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes. Class level explained 24% and school level 8% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83Â·6%), detected first on March 2nd, although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 68Â·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T ('Basel cluster'), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the 'Basel cluster', some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data, allows connection and interpretation of events, and can inform public health interventions.

An association between anxiety and increased body weight has been documented. Identifying associations between diet quality and anxiety may facilitate the development of preventive dietary policy, particularly relevant since obesity appears to increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In this study we aim to examine associations between changes in diet pattern and body weight and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among Israeli respondents to an international online survey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Conducted between March 30-April 252,020, this was cross-sectional, international and online study. The questionnaire was developed and tested in Hebrew and translated into six other languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian. The survey was conducted on a Google Survey platform, the link to which was posted on several social media platforms. Adults aged 18 or older who saw and responded to the link on a social media site comprised the study population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of the 3979 eligible respondents, 1895 indicated their current location as Israel. Most Israeli respondents completed the survey in Hebrew (83.2%) followed by Arabic (9.4%), though responses were recorded in all seven of the survey languages. The median age was 33 (IQâ€‰=â€‰22) years, and 75.7% were female. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet, and 25.2% indicated they had gained weight during the pandemic. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQâ€‰=â€‰3). While the median General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score was 5 (IQâ€‰=â€‰8), only 37.3% of participants reported at least mild anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 5 or more), while 10.7% reported moderate anxiety or greater (a GAD-7 score of 10 or more). In a multivariate logistic regression model of at least mild anxiety, being male and completing the survey in Hebrew significantly reduced odds of at least mild anxiety, while a worsening of diet quality during the pandemic, weight gain, and isolation significantly increased odds of at least mild anxiety.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">During the COVID pandemic, changes in nutrition quality and habits were associated with greater anxiety. These findings suggest the need for routine and continuous surveillance of the nutritional and psychological consequences of outbreaks as part of healthcare preparedness efforts. Organizations responsible for community-based health services (such as Israeli health plans) should adopt specific interventions to improve case finding and support individuals at increased risk of anxiety and declining nutrition status within primary healthcare settings. These interventions should include the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers. Primary care physicians should refer people with high anxiety or substantial weight gain during the pandemic to appropriate mental health and dietetic treatment, as needed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">NCT04353934 .</AbstractText>",NCT04353934,Abstract,3/31/2020,5/1/2021,Observational,The Ariel University Survey on Dietary Changes and Anxiety During the Coronavirus Pandemic,Recruiting,NA,Ariel University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04353934,1,0,1,0,NA,Israel,0,1,NA,0,136,0.9922307912025136,0.5,0,1.4922307912025135

We aimed to investigate whether treatment with rituximab is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">In this cohort study, we analysed data from the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, which included patients aged 18 years or older with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with rituximab (rituximab group) compared with patients who did not receive rituximab (no rituximab group). Severe disease was defined as that requiring admission to an intensive care unit or leading to death. Secondary objectives were to analyse deaths and duration of hospital stay. The inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score method was used to adjust for potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body-mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure, and the underlying disease [rheumatoid arthritis <i>vs</i> others]). Odds ratios and hazard ratios and their 95% CIs were calculated as effect size, by dividing the two population mean differences by their SD.

All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss.

Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes. <b>Methods:</b> Fourteen out of the randomly selected sample of the <i>Ciao Corona</i> cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days. <b>Results:</b> Out of 1,299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least one of two testings. None of the teachers but one child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 h to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. Thirty-five percent of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing. <b>Conclusion:</b> In a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Kriemler, Ulyte, Ammann, Peralta, Berger, Puhan and Radtke.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04448717,Abstract,6/16/2020,3/31/2021,Observational,Longitudinal Study of Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Development of Immunity in School Children,Recruiting,NA,University of Zurich,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717,4,0,4,0,NA,Switzerland,0,1,COVID-19 Antibody testing,0,135,0.9922879177377892,0.5,0,1.4922879177377892

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P &lt; .001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax Â± anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies &lt;12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels â‰¥550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels â‰¥40 mg/dL.

We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65Â years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (nÂ =Â 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (nÂ =Â 401, 35%), and obesity (nÂ =Â 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy.

However, few studies have assessed the latent dimensionality of the DSM-XC or provided guidance on how to score the survey. In this report, we examined the factor structure of the DSM-XC in a sample of over 3500 participants enrolled in a protocol on the mental health impact of COVID-19 conducted through the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP) ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04339790 ). We began by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the best solution for our data, and then employed a confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to evaluate the fit of the two-factor solution proposed by Lace and Merz (Lace &amp; Merz, 2020), the fit of our proposed solution, and the measurement invariance of our proposed solution across age, sex, and calendar time. We found a six-factor solution stemming from our EFAs to best fit our data. Each factor captures symptoms related to a specific construct of psychopathology: mood, worry, activation, somatic, confusion, and substance use.

Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are considered an important addition to molecular tests in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly because of their fast turnaround time, easier analytical procedure and lower price. However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2Â weeks after the last swab was collected to evaluate the serological status.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from 36 HCWs were obtained.

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets.

Rapid antigen (AG) tests provide results within minutes; however, their accuracy has been questioned. The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening.

Disease extent on CT has been reported to influence prognosis. Purpose To create a large publicly available dataset and assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods This multicenter observational retrospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04355507) involved 20 French university hospitals. Eligible subjects presented at the emergency departments of the hospitals involved between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and underwent both thoracic CT and RT-PCR for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images were read blinded to initial reports, RT-PCR, demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and outcome. Readers classified CT scans as positive or negative for COVID-19, based on criteria published by the French Society of Radiology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a model predicting severe outcome (intubation or death) at 1-month follow-up in subjects positive for both RT-PCR and CT, using clinical and radiological features. Results Of 10,930 subjects screened for eligibility, 10,735 (median age 65 years, interquartile range, 51-77 years; 6,147 men) were included and 6,448 (60.0%) had a positive RT-PCR result. With RT-PCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity and CT were 80.2% (95%CI: 79.3, 81.2) and 79.7% (95%CI: 78.5, 80.9), respectively with strong agreement between junior and senior radiologists (Gwet's AC1 coefficient: 0.79) Of all the variables analysed, the extent of pneumonia on CT (OR 3.25, 95%CI: 2.71, 3.89) was the best predictor of severe outcome at one month. A score based solely on clinical variables predicted a severe outcome with an AUC of 0.64 (95%CI: 0.62, 0.66), improving to 0.69 (95%CI: 0.6, 0.71) when it also included the extent of pneumonia and coronary calcium score on CT. Conclusion Using pre-defined criteria, CT reading is not influenced by reader's experience and helps predict the outcome at one month. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Professional interviewers carried out computer-assisted telephone interviews (1-30 June 2020). Thirty-day STB was assessed using modified items from the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Distal (i.e. pre-pandemic) risk factors included sociodemographic variables, number of physical health conditions and pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders; proximal (i.e. pandemic) risk factors included current mental disorders and a range of adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic. Logistic regression was used to investigate individual-level associations (odds ratios [OR]) and population-level associations (population attributable risk proportions [PARP]) between risk factors and 30-day STB. All data were weighted using post-stratification survey weights.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Estimated prevalence of 30-day STB was 4.5% (1.8% active suicidal ideation; n = 5 [0.1%] suicide attempts). STB was 9.7% among the 34.3% of respondents with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, and 1.8% among the 65.7% without any pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorder. Factors significantly associated with STB were pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders (total PARP = 49.1%) and current mental disorders (total PARP = 58.4%), i.e. major depressive disorder (OR = 6.0; PARP = 39.2%), generalised anxiety disorder (OR = 5.6; PARP = 36.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 4.6; PARP = 26.6%), panic attacks (OR = 6.7; PARP = 36.6%) and alcohol/substance use disorder (OR = 3.3; PARP = 5.9%). Pandemic-related adverse events-experiences associated with STB were lack of social support, interpersonal stress, stress about personal health and about the health of loved ones (PARPs 32.7-42.6%%), and having loved ones infected with COVID-19 (OR = 1.7; PARP = 18.8%).

During hospitalization, 17 patients developed VTE (4 deep-vein thrombosis, 15 pulmonary embolism), 12 following and 5 prior to LUS. In fully adjusted multivariable Cox models (excluding participants with VTE prior to LUS), all LUS parameters were significantly associated with VTE (total number of B-lines: HRâ€‰=â€‰1.14, 95% CI (1.03, 1.26) per 1 B-line increase), positive B-line score: HRâ€‰=â€‰9.79, 95% CI (1.87, 51.35), and LUS-score: HRâ€‰=â€‰1.51, 95% CI (1.10, 2.07), per 1-point increase).

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0-10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation.

There is an urgent need to define the best care courses of patients with COVID-19, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), according to their individualised benefit/risk ratio. Since older age is associated with poorer short-term and long-term outcomes, prediction models are needed, that may assist clinicians in their ICU admission decision. Senior-COVID-Rea was designed to evaluate, in patients over 60 years old admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 disease, the impact of age and geriatric and paraclinical parameters on their mortality 30 days after ICU admission.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND ANALYSIS"">This is a multicentre survey protocol to be conducted in seven hospitals of the Auvergne-RhÃ´ne-Alpes region, France. All patients over 60 years old admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 infection (or their legally acceptable representative) will be proposed to enter the study and to fill in a questionnaire regarding their functional and nutritional parameters 1â€‰month before COVID-19 infection. Paraclinical parameters at ICU admission will be collected: lymphocytes and neutrophils counts, high-fluorescent lymphoid cells and immature granulocytes percentages (Sysmex data), D-dimers, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, CT scan for lung extension rate as well as clinical resuscitation scores, and the delay between the first signs of infection and ICU admission. The primary outcome will be the overall survival at day 30 post-ICU admission. The analysis of factors predicting mortality at day 30 will be carried out using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Multivariate logistic regression will consider up to 15 factors.The ambition of this trial, which takes into account the different approaches of geriatric vulnerability, is to define the respective abilities of different operational criteria of frailty to predict patients' outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION"">The study protocol was ethically approved.

Following the hypothesis from our pilot study, we now validate an algorithm harnessing urinalysis to predict the outcome and the need for ICU resources on admission to hospital. Patients were screened for urinalysis, serum albumin (SA) and antithrombin III activity (AT-III) obtained prospectively on admission. The risk for an unfavorable course was categorized as (1) ""low"", (2) ""intermediate"" or (3) ""high"", depending on (1) normal urinalysis, (2) abnormal urinalysis with SA â‰¥ 2 g/dL and AT-III â‰¥ 70%, or (3) abnormal urinalysis with SA or AT-III abnormality. Time to ICU admission or death served as the primary endpoint. Among 223 screened patients, 145 were eligible for enrollment, 43 falling into the low, 84 intermediate, and 18 into high-risk categories. An abnormal urinalysis significantly elevated the risk for ICU admission or death (63.7% vs. 27.9%; HR 2.6; 95%-CI 1.4 to 4.9; <i>p</i> = 0.0020) and was 100% in the high-risk group. Having an abnormal urinalysis was associated with mortality, a need for mechanical ventilation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy.

The clinical role of chest computed tomography (CT) in describing the progression of COVID-19-associated lung injury remains to be clarified. We investigated in COVID-19 patients the regional distribution of lung injury and the influence of clinical and laboratory features on its progression.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This was a prospective study. For each CT, twenty images, evenly spaced along the cranio-caudal axis, were selected. For regional analysis, each CT image was divided into three concentric subpleural regions of interest and four quadrants. Hyper-, normally, hypo- and non-inflated lung compartments were defined. Nonparametric tests were used for hypothesis testing (Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05). Spearman correlation test was used to detect correlations between lung compartments and clinical features.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Twenty-three out of 111 recruited patients were eligible for further analysis. Five hundred-sixty CT images were analyzed. Lung injury, composed by hypo- and non-inflated areas, was significantly more represented in subpleural than in core lung regions. A secondary, centripetal spread of lung injury was associated with exposure to mechanical ventilation (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.04), longer spontaneous breathing (more than 14Â days, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) and non-protective tidal volume (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.04). Positive fluid balance (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), high plasma D-dimers (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and ferritin (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.04) were associated with increased lung injury.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a predominant subpleural distribution of lung injury is observed. Prolonged spontaneous breathing and high tidal volumes, both causes of patient self-induced lung injury, are associated to an extensive involvement of more central regions.

34368662,Journal Article, , ,Effect of co-infection with intestinal parasites on COVID-19 severity: A prospective observational cohort study.,2021-08-10,EClinicalMedicine,"<AbstractText><i>Background:</i> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. Evidence from Africa indicates that significantly less COVID-19 patients suffer from serious symptoms than in the industrialized world. We and others previously postulated a partial explanation for this phenomenon, being a different, more activated immune system due to parasite infections. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating a potential correlation of co-infection with parasites with COVID-19 severity in an endemic area in Africa. <i>Methods:</i> Ethiopian COVID-19 patients were enrolled and screened for intestinal parasites, between July 2020 and March 2021. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between parasite infection, and COVID-19 severity. Models were adjusted for sex, age, residence, education level, occupation, body mass index, and comorbidities. <i>Findings:</i> 751 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, of whom 284 (37.8%) had intestinal parasitic infection. Only 27/255 (10.6%) severe COVID-19 patients were co-infected with intestinal parasites, while 257/496 (51.8%) non-severe COVID-19 patients were parasite positive (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). Patients co-infected with parasites had lower odds of developing severe COVID-19, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17-0.30; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for all parasites, aOR 0.37 ([95% CI 0.26-0.51]; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for protozoa, and aOR 0.26 ([95% CI 0.19-0.35]; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) for helminths. When stratified by species, co-infection with <i>Entamoeba</i> spp., <i>Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni</i>, and <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> implied lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. There were 11 deaths (1.5%), and all were among patients without parasites (<i>p</i>Â =Â 0.009). <i>Interpretation:</i> Parasite co-infection is associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in African patients. Parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyper-inflammation associated with severe COVID-19. <i>Funding:</i> European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) - European Union, and Joep Lange Institute (JLI), The Netherlands. <i>Trial registration:</i> Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04473365.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04473365,Abstract,7/20/2020,6/30/2021,Observational,Rapid Diagnostic Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),Recruiting,NA,Mekelle University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04473365,1,0,1,0,NA,Ethiopia,0,3,Intestinal parasite,0,6,0.9996572407883462,1,0,1.9996572407883462

However, for studies conducted in ICU, the pooled sensitivity of presepsin was found to be higher than PCT (0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.92 vs. 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.81), while the pooled specificity of presepsin was lower than PCT (0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.73 vs. 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.83).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Based on the results of our meta-analysis, presepsin is a promising marker for diagnosis of sepsis as PCT or CRP, but its results should be interpreted more carefully and cautiously since too few studies were included and those studies had high heterogeneity between them.

Most published evidence focuses on symptoms of mental health problems (such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety) and psychosocial factors increasing the risk of such symptoms. However, a recent shift in the literature has moved to exploring resilience and the absence of adverse lasting mental health effects following a disaster. This paper undertakes a qualitative review of the literature to explore factors affecting psychological resilience, as well as the potential positive impact of experiencing a disaster (post-traumatic growth) by examining the literature on employees in disaster-exposed organisations. We identify several protective factors: training, experience, and perceived (personal) competence; social support; and effective coping strategies. Post-traumatic growth frequently appeared to occur at both personal and professional levels for those rescue staff after a disaster, giving employees a greater appreciation of life and their relationships, enhancing their self-esteem and providing a sense of accomplishment and better understanding of their work. Implications, in terms of how to build a resilient workforce, are discussed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2020.

Identification was through Cox proportional hazards modeling of ROX association with HFNC outcome. The most specific cutoff of the ROX index to predict HFNC failure and success was assessed. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Among the 191 patients treated with HFNC in the validation cohort, 68 (35.6%) required intubation. The prediction accuracy of the ROX index increased over time (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 2 h, 0.679; 6 h, 0.703; 12 h, 0.759). ROX greater than or equal to 4.88 measured at 2 (hazard ratio, 0.434; 95% confidence interval, 0.264-0.715; <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.001), 6 (hazard ratio, 0.304; 95% confidence interval, 0.182-0.509; <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), or 12 hours (hazard ratio, 0.291; 95% confidence interval, 0.161-0.524; <i>P</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) after HFNC initiation was consistently associated with a lower risk for intubation. A ROX less than 2.85, less than 3.47, and less than 3.85 at 2, 6, and 12 hours of HFNC initiation, respectively, were predictors of HFNC failure. Patients who failed presented a lower increase in the values of the ROX index over the 12 hours. Among components of the index, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry/Fi<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> had a greater weight than respiratory rate. <b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with pneumonia with acute respiratory failure treated with HFNC, ROX is an index that can help identify those patients with low and those with high risk for intubation.

The rest-activity circadian rhythms (RARs) are involved in the control of the sleep-wake cycle and altered RARs could lead to a compromised health status. Many studies focused on examining sleep behavior and circadian rhythms in physically active subjects or athletes but, unexpectedly, no data on RARs are available. Therefore, we studied the existence of the RAR in athletes and the possible difference in RAR's characteristics among sport disciplines. The study had a prospective observational design and RARs were recorded for five consecutive training days through actigraphy (Actiwatch 2 actigraph; Philips Respironics, OR, USA) in 43 athletes (mean age: 25.6Â Â±Â 3.2Â years). Athletes competed in three different disciplines and had different training schedules and competition levels: professional triathletes (N =Â 10; 6 females and 4 males) had 2 morning (08:30-12:00) and 1 afternoon (15:00-17:00) training sessions, professional volleyball players (N =Â 19; 12 females and 7 males) used to train once in the morning (09:00-11:30) and once in the afternoon (15:00-18:00), and non-professional soccer players (N =Â 14; all males) trained always late in the evening (20:30-22:30). To determine the existence of RARs, the activity counts (A.C.) data were analyzed using the single and the population mean cosinor method; a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was used for the comparison of RAR characteristics among soccer, volleyball and triathlon athletes. Partial eta squared (Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) was used to determine the magnitude of the effect for significant outcomes (Î±Â =Â 0.05) in ANOVA. The presence of a significant RAR both for each of the 43 athletes (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and for the three categories of athletes (p &lt;Â 0.001) was observed. RARs differed among sport disciplines: the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm (MESOR) was significantly higher in triathletes (mean: 347 A.C. with 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 314-379) compared to both volleyball (mean: 188 A.C. with 95% CI: 173-203; p &lt;Â 0.001) and soccer players (mean: 289 A.C. with 95% CI: 267-312; p &lt;Â 0.01) with Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.72. Amplitude (A) values showed the same significant trend of MESOR data (ANOVA: p &lt;Â 0.001; Î®<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.65) while the acrophase (Î¦) occurred at 18:28 for soccer players, significantly later than triathlon (15:20Â h; p &lt;Â 0.001) and volleyball players (16:24Â h; p &lt;Â 0.001) (ANOVA: p &lt;Â 0.001; Î®p2Â =Â 0.84). The higher training duration and intensity reached by triathlon athletes in the morning sessions caused a phase advance of their RAR's acrophase Î¦ and higher MESOR and A amplitude compared to volleyball players and triathletes. Therefore, different sport disciplines require different training schedules, training loads and intensities that translate into different RARs. Strength coaches and medical staff of professional teams should strongly consider actigraphy as a practical and powerful tool to monitor RARs, sleep behavior, and the activity levels of their athletes; highlighting potential circadian disruptions through actigraphy could be helpful to prevent musculoskeletal injuries.</AbstractText>",NCT04632615,Registry,5/22/2020,3/31/2021,Observational,Sleep Behaviour in Athletes During Home Confinement Due to the Covid-19 Outbreak,"Active, not recruiting",NA,Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04632615,0,8,8,0,NA,Italy,0,1,NA,0,432,0.9753213367609255,0.5,0,1.4753213367609255

The aim of this study was to compare two different methods for assessing seminal OS and their ability to predict sperm DNA fragmentation and abnormal semen parameters. Semen samples were collected from 520 men attending for routine diagnostic testing following informed consent. Oxidative stress was assessed using either a chemiluminescence assay to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) or an electrochemical assay to measure oxidation reduction potential (sORP). Sperm DNA fragmentation (DFI) and sperm with immature chromatin (HDS) were assessed using sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Semen analysis was performed according to WHO 2010 guidelines. Reactive oxygen species sORP and DFI are negatively correlated with sperm motility (<i>p</i> = 0.0012, 0.0002, &lt;0.0001 respectively) and vitality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001, 0.019, &lt;0.0001 respectively).

Samples with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have excessive ROS levels compared to those without (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), but sORP and DFI in this group are not significantly increased. DNA fragmentation was significantly elevated in samples with OS measured by ROS (<i>p</i> = 0.0052) or sORP (<i>p</i> = 0.004).

We report high repeatability and reproducibility across different field strengths, manufacturers, and scanner models in standardized cT1 (repeatability CoV: 1.7%, bias -7.5ms, 95% LoA of -53.6 ms to 38.5 ms; reproducibility CoV 3.3%, bias 6.5 ms, 95% LoA of -76.3 to 89.2 ms) and T2* (repeatability CoV: 5.5%, bias -0.18 ms, 95% LoA -5.41 to 5.05 ms; reproducibility CoV 6.6%, bias -1.7 ms, 95% LoA -6.61 to 3.15 ms) in human measurements. PDFF repeatability (0.8%) and reproducibility (0.75%) coefficients showed high precision of this metric. Similar precision was observed in phantom measurements. Inspection of the ICC model indicated that most of the variance in cT1 could be accounted for by study participants (ICC = 0.91), with minimal contribution from technical differences. We demonstrate that multiparametric MRI is a non-invasive, repeatable and reproducible method for quantifying liver tissue characteristics across manufacturers (Philips and Siemens) and field strengths (1.5T and 3T).</AbstractText>",NCT04369807,Registry,4/21/2020,5/31/2023,Observational,Mapping Organ Health Following COVID-19 Disease Due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection,Recruiting,NA,Perspectum,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04369807,1,16,17,0,NA,United Kingdom,0,1,Outpatient MRI,0,592,0.9661810911168238,0.5,0,1.4661810911168238

We questioned whether the number of circulating donor-specific IL-21 producing cells (pc) can predict kidney transplant rejection, and evaluated this in two different patient cohorts. The first analysis was done on pre-transplantation samples of 35 kidney transplant recipients of whom 15 patients developed an early acute rejection. The second study concerned peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 46 patients obtained at 6 months after kidney transplantation of whom 13 developed late rejection. Significantly higher frequencies of donor-specific IL-21 pc were found by Elispot assay in both patients who developed early and late rejection compared to those without rejection. In addition, low frequencies of donor-specific IL-21 pc were associated with higher rejection-free survival. Moreover, low pre-transplant donor-specific IL-21 pc numbers were associated with the absence of anti-HLA antibodies. Donor-reactive IL-21 was mainly produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including CD4<sup>+</sup> follicular T helper cells. In conclusion, the number of donor-specific IL-21 pc is associated with an increased risk of both early and late rejection, giving it the potential to be a new biomarker in kidney transplantation.</AbstractText>",NCT04841785,Registry,4/22/2021,5/1/2023,Observational,Long Term Efficacy and Safety of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Vaccination in Kidney Disease Patients,Recruiting,NA,University Medical Center Groningen,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04841785,0,11,11,0,NA,Netherlands,0,1,mailer-based finger-prick,0,369,0.9789203084832905,0.5,0,1.4789203084832905

Despite this improved understanding, no pharmacologic therapies aimed at the underlying biology have been proven effective in ARDS. Increasingly, ARDS has been recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by subphenotypes with distinct clinical, radiographic, and biologic differences, distinct outcomes, and potentially distinct responses to therapy. The Berlin Definition of ARDS specifies three severity classifications: mild, moderate, and severe based on the PaO<sub>2</sub> to FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a potential benefit to prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade in moderate to severe phenotypes of ARDS only. Precipitating risk factor, direct versus indirect lung injury, and timing of ARDS onset can determine other clinical phenotypes of ARDS after admission. Radiographic phenotypes of ARDS have been described based on a diffuse versus focal pattern of infiltrates on chest imaging. Finally and most promisingly, biologic subphenotypes or endotypes have increasingly been identified using plasma biomarkers, genetics, and unbiased approaches such as latent class analysis. The potential of precision medicine lies in identifying novel therapeutics aimed at ARDS biology and the subpopulation within ARDS most likely to respond. In this review, we discuss the challenges and approaches to subphenotype ARDS into clinical, radiologic, severity, and biologic phenotypes with an eye toward the future of precision medicine in critical care.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04692779,Registry,1/31/2021,10/30/2021,Observational,A Prospective Clinical Study to Explore Response to Prone Positioning in ARDS Patients,Recruiting,NA,Rush University Medical Center,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04692779,0,18,18,1,78821324,United States,0,2,Lung Ultrasound (LUS),0,482,0.9724650099971437,0.5,0,2.4724650099971437

As a consequence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, obesity was identified for the first time as a risk factor for increased disease severity and mortality in infected individuals. Over-nutrition that results in obesity causes a chronic state of meta-inflammation with systemic implications for immunity. Obese hosts exhibit delayed and blunted antiviral responses to influenza virus infection, and they experience poor recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines is reduced in this population and obesity may also play a role in altering the viral life cycle, thus complementing the already weakened immune response and leading to severe pathogenesis. Case studies and basic research in human cohorts and animal models have highlighted the prolonged viral shed in the obese host, as well as a microenvironment that permits the emergence of virulent minor variants. This review focuses on influenza A virus pathogenesis in the obese host, and on the impact of obesity on the antiviral response, viral shed, and viral evolution. We comprehensively analyze the recent literature on how and why viral pathogenesis is altered in the obese host along with the impact of the altered host and pathogenic state on viral evolutionary dynamics in multiple models. Finally, we summarized the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals in this populations and the questions that remain to be answered. If current trends continue, nearly 50% of the worldwide population is projected to be obese by 2050. This population will have a growing impact on both non-communicable and communicable diseases and may affect global evolutionary trends of influenza virus.</AbstractText>",NCT04480034,Registry,7/15/2020,1/31/2021,Observational,Obesity Surgery During 2020 Italian Pandemic,Recruiting,NA,University of Roma La Sapienza,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04480034,0,20,20,0,NA,Italy,0,1,Bariatric procedures,0,441,0.9748071979434447,0.5,0,1.4748071979434447

NETs are increasingly recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. NETs are composed of a complex mix of intracellularly derived material that neutrophils organize within the cytoplasm and then expel in a nondirected manner in the vicinity of invading organisms. Combined, these trap and destroy multiple genera of microbes including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoans, limiting infection especially where phagocytosis is not possible. At first, NET formation was thought to be a terminal event for neutrophils; however, it is now apparent that some neutrophils survive this process, becoming anuclear, and may drive ongoing tissue damage. NETs are now known to be directly cytotoxic to lung epithelium and endothelium, and their excessive production is seen in pneumonia and acute lung injury as well as several chronic diseases, including COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. NETs also appear to play a role in both tumor defense and dissemination, depending on the local microenvironment and the specific tumor subtype. It is becoming increasingly apparent that NET formation can exert a positive or negative influence on multiple respiratory pathologies and that simply globally reducing or increasing NET formation is unlikely to be a therapeutic success. Rather, as our understanding grows, it is likely that targeted NET up- or downregulation along with destruction or protection of already formed NETs may become an additional point of intervention for respiratory physicians.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

All included studies were reviews (46), meta-analyses (one), original research studies (18) and guideline articles (one). The studies were published between 1984 and 2018. Under normal physiological conditions, ROS are vital for sperm maturation, hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosome reaction, as well as fertilisation. However, a number of endogenous and exogenous causes may induce supra-physiological levels of ROS resulting in lipid peroxidation, sperm DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, and consequently infertility. Several laboratory testing methods can be used in infertile men to diagnose OS. Treatment usually involves antioxidant supplementation and, when possible, elimination of the causative factor. <b>Conclusion</b>: OS is an important cause of male factor infertility. Its assessment provides essential information that can guide treatment strategies aimed at improving the male's reproductive potential. <b>Abbreviations:</b> bp: base-pair; CAT: catalase; LPO: lipid peroxidation; MDA: malondialdehyde; MiOXSYS: Male Infertility Oxidative System; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; NAD(PH): nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); NO: nitric oxide; 8-OHdG: 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine; ORP: oxidation-reduction potential; OS: oxidative stress; PKA: protein kinase A; PLA2: phospholipase A2; PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PUFA: poly-unsaturated fatty acid; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; TAC: total antioxidant capacity; TBA: thiobarbituric acid.</AbstractText>",NCT04748172,Registry,2/1/2021,2/28/2022,Observational,COVID-19 Vaccine and Ovarian Reserve,Recruiting,NA,Sheba Medical Center,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04748172,0,12,12,0,NA,Israel,0,1,SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccines|AMH sampling,0,320,0.9817195087117966,0.5,0,1.4817195087117967

The intent is to provide an overview of reactogenicity after vaccination to help the vaccine community, including healthcare professionals, in maintaining confidence in vaccines by promoting vaccination, setting expectations for vaccinees about what might occur after vaccination and reducing anxiety by managing the vaccination setting.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04944433,Registry,4/9/2021,6/9/2022,Observational,Safety and Efficacy of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients,"Active, not recruiting",NA,Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04944433,0,7,7,0,NA,Argentina,0,0,NA,0,319,0.9817766352470723,0,0,0.9817766352470723

We explored this technique in a cohort of code stroke patients to see whether a signature could be identified to aid in the diagnosis of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A military-grade three-axis accelerometer was affixed to a headset. Accelerometer and electrocardiogram (ECG) outputs were digitized at 1.6Â kHz. We call the resulting digitized signals the ""headpulse."" Three-minute recordings were performed immediately after computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) and/or immediately before and after attempted mechanical thrombectomy in patents with suspected stroke. The resulting waveforms were inspected by eye and then subjected to supervised machine learning (MATLAB Classification Learner R2018a) to train a model using fivefold cross-validation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of 42 code stroke subjects with recordings, 19 (45%) had LVO and 23 (55%) had normal CTAs. In patients without LVO, ECG-triggered waveforms followed a self-similar time course revealing that the headpulse is highly coupled to the cardiac contraction. However, in most patients with LVO, headpulses showed little cardiac contraction correlation. We term this abnormality ""chaos"" and parameterized it with 156 measures of trace-by-trace variation from the ECG-signal-averaged mean for machine learning model training. Selecting the best model, using biometric data only, we properly classified 15/19 LVOs and 20/23 non-LVO patients, with receiver operating characteristic curve areaâ€‰=â€‰0.79, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 87%, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001. Headpulse waveforms following thrombectomy showed return of cardiac contraction correlation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Headpulse recordings performed on patients with suspected acute stroke significantly identify those with LVO. The lack of temporal correlation of the headpulse with cardiac contraction and resolution to normal may reflect changes in cerebral blood flow and may provide a useful technique to triage stroke patients for thrombectomy using a noninvasive device.</AbstractText>",NCT04445493,Registry,3/1/2021,7/31/2021,Observational,EPISODE-PS-COVID: hEad Pulse for Ischemic StrOke DEtection Prehospital Study During the COVID-19 Pandemic ( EPISODEPSCOVID ),Recruiting,NA,"MindRhythm, Inc.",NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04445493,0,1,1,1,81107808,United States,0,3,MindRhythm Harmony,0,206,0.988231933733219,1,0,2.988231933733219

Twenty-nine non-professional players were recruited and allocated to either an experimental group (EG, n = 17) that received SH education, or a control group (CG, n = 12). SSG consisted of 3 Ã— 4 min in a 4vs4, with 3 min of recovery and was performed at 8.00 p.m. Sleep quality was monitored via actigraphy and sleep diary entries before (PRE) and two nights after (POST1, POST2) the SSG. Sleep latency (SL) differed between the two groups at POST1 (4.9 Â± 5.4 vs. 15.5 Â± 16.1 for EG and CG, respectively; p = 0.017, effect size [ES] = 2.0); SL values were lower at POST1 compared to PRE for the EG (-47%; p = 0.021, ES = 0.6). Subjective sleep quality was better in the EG than the CG at POST1 (8.6 Â± 1.0 vs. 7.1 Â± 2.0 for EG and CG, respectively; p = 0.016, ES = 0.9) with a significant improvement over PRE-values (+11.0%, p = 0.004, ES = 0.8). Although SL and subjective sleep quality did not decrease significantly from POST1 to POST2 values at POST2 no longer differed significantly form baseline and, hence, indicate that observed effects may be short-lasting. No other objective sleep indices were influenced by late-evening training or SH practices implemented by the EG. Soccer players may benefit from acute SH strategies to reduce the time to sleep onset after late-evening training sessions.</AbstractText>",NCT04632615,Registry,5/22/2020,3/31/2021,Observational,Sleep Behaviour in Athletes During Home Confinement Due to the Covid-19 Outbreak,"Active, not recruiting",NA,Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04632615,0,8,8,0,NA,Italy,0,1,NA,0,587,0.966466723793202,0.5,0,1.4664667237932019

Subsequent studies have demonstrated their implication in the pathophysiology of various diseases, due to the toxic effects of their main components on surrounding tissues. Several distinct NETosis pathways have been described in response to various triggers. Among these triggers, IgG immune complexes (IC) play an important role since they induce robust NET release upon binding to activating FcÎ³Rs on neutrophils. Few <i>in vitro</i> studies have documented the mechanisms of IC-induced NET release and evidence about the partners involved is controversial. <i>In vivo</i>, animal models and clinical studies have strongly suggested the importance of IgG IC-induced NET release for autoimmunity and anaphylaxis. In this review, we will focus on two autoimmune diseases in which NETs are undoubtedly major players, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We will also discuss anaphylaxis as another example of disease recently associated with IC-induced NET release. Understanding the role of IC-induced NETs in these settings will pave the way for new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2019 Granger, Peyneau, Chollet-Martin and de Chaisemartin.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04594356,Registry,11/19/2020,1/31/2021,Observational,"Assessment of Netosis During COVID-19, Under Treatment With Anakinra, an Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist","Active, not recruiting",NA,Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04594356,0,6,6,0,NA,France,0,2,NA,0,270,0.9845758354755784,0.5,0,1.4845758354755785

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.

The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methods-HFNC, HFNC+PP, NIV, NIV+PP-were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>â€‰&lt;â€‰100â€‰mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> in HFNC+PP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125â€‰Â±â€‰41â€‰mmHg vs 119â€‰Â±â€‰19â€‰mmHg, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated an upward trend in patients with all four support strategies: HFNC &lt; HFNC+PP â‰¤ NIV &lt; NIV+PP. The average duration for PP was 2â€‰h twice daily.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Early application of PP with HFNC, especially in patients with moderate ARDS and baseline SpO<sub>2</sub>â€‰&gt;â€‰95%, may help avoid intubation. The PP was well tolerated, and the efficacy on PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> of the four support strategies was HFNC &lt; HFNC+PP â‰¤ NIV &lt; NIV+PP.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99Â·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.

Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available.

Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (Â±standard deviation) of 4 days Â± 1 (range, 1-8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days Â± 4 (range, 11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.25, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0-4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 Â± 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5-8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 Â± 4; <i>P</i> = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9-13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 Â± 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (â‰¥14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 Â± 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with &gt;99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Yi xue ban = Journal of Zhejiang University. Medical sciences,"<AbstractText>The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.</AbstractText>",NCT04368351,Registry,3/1/2020,6/30/2020,Observational,Bacteriotherapy in the Treatment of COVID-19,"Active, not recruiting",NA,University of Roma La Sapienza,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368351,0,4,4,0,NA,Italy,0,1,SivoMixx (200 billion)|Azithromycin|hydroxychloroquine,0,518,0.9704084547272208,0.5,0,1.4704084547272207

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days Â± 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days Â± 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative.

Infectious diseases,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done â‰¤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (&gt;1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (&gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49Â·5 years (SD 11Â·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10Â·5 (SD 6Â·4) overall, 2Â·8 (3Â·3) in group 1, 11Â·1 (5Â·4) in group 2, 13Â·0 (5Â·7) in group 3, and 12Â·1 (5Â·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">None.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak.

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04369807,Registry,4/21/2020,5/31/2023,Observational,Mapping Organ Health Following COVID-19 Disease Due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection,Recruiting,NA,Perspectum,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04369807,1,16,17,0,NA,United Kingdom,0,1,Outpatient MRI,0,371,0.9788060554127392,0.5,0,1.4788060554127394

The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.</AbstractText>",NCT04344145,Registry,4/16/2020,5/25/2020,Observational,Exhaustion and Needs in Frontline COVID-19 Healthcare Workers: Cross-sectional Study in a Belgian Population,Completed,NA,UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04344145,1,15,16,0,NA,Belgium,0,4,NA,0,516,0.970522707797772,1,0,1.970522707797772

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.</AbstractText>",NCT04769284,Registry,2/12/2021,2/20/2021,Observational,Psychological State of Students of Health Sciences During COVID-19,Completed,NA,Instituto de InvestigaciÃ³n Sanitaria AragÃ³n,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04769284,0,5,5,0,NA,Spain,0,0,Mental health student,0,516,0.970522707797772,0,0,0.970522707797772

The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection an international public health emergency. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30â€ˆ000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend.

Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI): 82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI: 46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.

In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.

Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 7000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious 2 weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance, which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission, and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery, is addressed. In addition, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment, and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework that can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-Î±. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).</AbstractText>",NCT04594356,Registry,11/19/2020,1/31/2021,Observational,"Assessment of Netosis During COVID-19, Under Treatment With Anakinra, an Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist","Active, not recruiting",NA,Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04594356,0,6,6,0,NA,France,0,2,NA,0,467,0.9733219080262782,0.5,0,1.473321908026278

Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1Â·4% [0Â·4-3Â·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4Â·5% [1Â·8-11Â·1] in those aged â‰¥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0Â·66% (0Â·39-1Â·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18Â·4% (11Â·0-37Â·6) in those aged 80 years or older.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">UK Medical Research Council.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century. The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease. The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic. The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.</AbstractText>",NCT04763213,Registry,1/1/2018,12/31/2019,Observational,New Predictors in Determining the Need for Invasive Treatment in Non-STEMI,Completed,NA,Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04763213,0,8,8,0,NA,Turkey,0,0,Coronary Angiography|Coronary Angiography,0,493,0.9718366181091117,0,0,0.9718366181091117

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.</AbstractText>",NCT04441814,Registry,7/23/2019,7/31/2021,Observational,FOUND - Ancillary Study to Smile Protocol NCT03654105,Enrolling by invitation,NA,"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano",NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04441814,0,7,7,0,NA,Italy,0,1,NA,0,493,0.9718366181091117,0.5,0,1.4718366181091116

Compared with other monitoring modalities, such as auscultation or radiographic imaging, we argue lung ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy, is ergonomically favourable and has fewer infection control implications. By informing the initiation, escalation, titration and weaning of respiratory support, lung ultrasound can be integrated into COVID-19 care pathways for patients with respiratory failure. Given the unprecedented pressure on healthcare services currently, supporting and educating clinicians is a key enabler of the wider implementation of lung ultrasound. This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19-associated lung injury. Mechanisms by which the potential lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed are explored, including a pragmatic approach to training, governance, imaging, interpretation of images and implementation of lung ultrasound into routine clinical practice.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines â€œcytokine stormâ€ leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04819165,Registry,3/1/2020,12/31/2020,Observational,Healthcare-associated Infections in Severe COVID-19 During 2020,Completed,NA,Sanatorio Anchorena San Martin,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04819165,0,7,7,0,NA,Argentina,0,0,COVID-19,0,481,0.9725221365324193,0,0,0.9725221365324193

Given the overwhelming demand on facility capacity, the impact on all health care sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of health care capacities. In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis. This study offers a novel approach to informed guidance for health care management when a priori no scientific evidence is available.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Authors.

Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy. Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection. Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions. Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice.

Purpose To introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for use in the standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on unenhanced chest CT images and to report its initial interobserver agreement and performance. Materials and Methods The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated by using 105 chest CT scans of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and in whom reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed (mean, 62 years Â± 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR results). Eight observers used CO-RADS to assess the scans. Fleiss Îº value was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared with the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared with results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss Îº value was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 0.47), with the highest Îº value for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false-negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was nine of 161 cases (5.6%; 95% CI: 1.0%, 10%), and the false-positive rate for CO-RADS category 5 was one of 286 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0%, 1.0%). Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 at unenhanced chest CT that performs very well in predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.

No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic.

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8Â % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23Â % in the following month and even more by 33Â % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25Â %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise du Cancer.

Psychiatry,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and assessment of study quality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12Â·2 years (SD 4Â·1) to 68Â·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27Â·9%; 95% CI 20Â·5-36Â·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32Â·6%; 24Â·7-40Â·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35Â·7%; 27Â·6-44Â·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34Â·1%; 26Â·2-42Â·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41Â·9%; 22Â·5-50Â·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0Â·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10Â·5%; 95% CI 7Â·5-14Â·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12Â·1%; 8Â·6-16Â·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12Â·3%; 7Â·7-17Â·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12Â·8%; 8Â·7-17Â·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18Â·9%; 14Â·1-24Â·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19Â·3%; 15Â·1-23Â·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30Â·4%; 23Â·9-37Â·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100Â·0%; 88Â·0-100Â·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32Â·2% (95% CI 23Â·7-42Â·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14Â·9% (12Â·1-18Â·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14Â·8% (11Â·1-19Â·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76Â·9%; 95% CI 68Â·1-84Â·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35Â·3 months (SD 40Â·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Wellcome Trust, UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK Medical Research Council, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University College London.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time. This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into account health care resource units (HCRUs), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of 3/6 months. For 94 912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482 022 LYGs requiring 1 052 949 HCRUs.

Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4Â Â±Â 8.8Â yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52-7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10-16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (<i>n</i> = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean Â± SD 3.0 Â± 1.6 kg) and loss (-2.9 Â± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36-45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.</AbstractText>",NCT04700254,Registry,12/28/2020,1/11/2021,Observational,"Anxiety, Depression and Eating Attitudes of Diabetes Mellitus Patients During COVID-19 Lockdown in Greece",Completed,NA,"Chania General Hospital ""St. George""",NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04700254,0,5,5,0,NA,Greece,0,4,DASS questionnaire|EAT-26 questionnaire,0,427,0.9756069694373036,1,0,1.9756069694373037

The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems, especially the lungs and heart. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. In our review of clinical analyses, we found that in 26 studies including 11,685 patients, the weighted pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was 20% (ranged from 5% to 38% depending on the criteria used). The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and 'endotheliitis' in several organs including the heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification. In patients with elevated hs-troponin, clinical context is important and myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential, along with type I and type II myocardial infarction. Irrespective of etiology, patients with acute myocardial injury should be prioritized for treatment. Clinical decisions including interventions should be individualized and carefully tailored after thorough review of risks/benefits. Given the complex interplay of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, further investigation into potential mechanisms is needed to guide effective therapies. Randomized trials are urgently needed to investigate treatment modalities to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with COVID-19 related acute myocardial injury.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

For that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling. A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire. Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits. Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 Â± 2 to 7.34 Â± 1.93 during the confinement. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement. COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet.

Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18-75 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO<sub>2</sub>]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04365959, and is now complete.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Between March 20 and April 9, 2020, we enrolled 56 patients, of whom 44 (79%) were male; the mean age was 57Â·4 years (SD 7Â·4) and the mean BMI was 27Â·5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (3Â·7). Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (83Â·9% [95% CI 71Â·7 to 92Â·4]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio 180Â·5 mm Hg [SD 76Â·6] in supine position vs 285Â·5 mm Hg [112Â·9] in prone position; p&lt;0Â·0001). After resupination, improved oxygenation was maintained in 23 patients (50Â·0% [95% CI 34Â·9-65Â·1]; ie, responders); however, this improvement was on average not significant compared with before prone positioning (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio 192Â·9 mm Hg [100Â·9] 1 h after resupination; p=0Â·29). Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 12Â·7 mg/L [SD 6Â·9] in responders vs 8Â·4 mg/L [6Â·2] in non-responders; and platelets: 241Â·1â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>3</sup>/Î¼L [101Â·9] vs 319Â·8â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10<sup>3</sup>/Î¼L [120Â·6]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (2Â·7 days [SD 2Â·1] in responders vs 4Â·6 days [3Â·7] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained. 13 (28%) of 46 patients were eventually intubated, seven (30%) of 23 responders and six (26%) of 23 non-responders (p=0Â·74).

In this retrospective study, serum calcium levels, hormone levels and clinical laboratory parameters on admission were recorded. The clinical outcome variables were also recorded. From February 10 to February 28, 2020, 241 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 180 (74.7%) had hypocalcemia on admission. The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, and median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with VD levels (<i>P</i> =0.004) but negatively correlated with PTH levels (<i>P</i> =0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially â‰¤2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidences of organ injury and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and 28-day mortality were 0.923 (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001), 0.905 (<i>P</i> =0.001), and 0.929 (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001), respectively. In conclusion, serum calcium was associated with the clinical severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

A 54-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The patient's O2 saturation was 80% using an oxygen mask, which was gradually declining. After 4 sessions of HP/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), O2 saturation reached to 95%, and the patient was transferred to the general ward. Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's dependence on oxygen, prevented other complications such as AKI and septic shock in the patient, and reduced mortality and hospital length of stay.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 S.

It is a scalp disorder characterized by excessive shedding of hair. Several factors such as drugs, trauma, and emotional and physiological stress can lead to the development of telogen effluvium. Multiple alterations in the hair cycle have been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Telogen effluvium can present as acute or chronic hair fall with symptoms such as trichodynia. Diagnostic tests that can be used include hair wash test, trichogram, phototrichogram, and scalp biopsy. In the treatment of telogen effluvium, it is essential to identify and remove the causative factors and to use drugs such as corticosteroids, minoxidil, and novel treatments such as CNPDA (caffeine, niacinamide, panthenol, dimethicone, and an acrylate polymer).

COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets or direct contact and infects the respiratory tract resulting in pneumonia in most of the cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in about 15 % of the cases. Mortality in COVID-19 patients has been linked to the presence of the so-called ""cytokine storm"" induced by the virus. Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines leads to ARDS aggravation and widespread tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure and death.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04643522,Registry,1/7/2020,10/5/2020,Observational,Semen Parameters and COVID-19 in Infertile Men,Completed,NA,Ankara City Hospital Bilkent,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04643522,0,4,4,0,NA,Turkey,0,1,Clinical assessment,0,167,0.9904598686089688,0.5,0,1.4904598686089687

Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30th. LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.</AbstractText>",NCT04689672,Registry,12/16/2020,5/10/2021,Observational,Predictivity of Hemogasanalysis and Lung UltraSound in Determining COVID-19 Severity,Recruiting,NA,IRCCS San Raffaele,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04689672,0,4,4,0,NA,Italy,0,0,Lung ultrasound,0,378,0.9784061696658097,0,0,0.9784061696658097

Because of the novelty of the disease, the possible impact on the endocrine system is not clear. To compile a mini-review describing possible endocrine consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a literature survey using the key words Covid-19, Coronavirus, SARS CoV-1, SARS Cov-2, Endocrine, and related terms in medical databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and MedARXiv from the year 2000. Additional references were identified through manual screening of bibliographies and via citations in the selected articles. The literature review is current until April 28, 2020. In light of the literature, we discuss SARS-CoV-2 and explore the endocrine consequences based on the experience with structurally-similar SARS-CoV-1. Studies from the SARS -CoV-1 epidemic have reported variable changes in the endocrine organs. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 system in the pancreas causing perturbation of insulin production resulting in hyperglycemic emergencies. In patients with preexisting endocrine disorders who develop COVID-19, several factors warrant management decisions. Hydrocortisone dose adjustments are required in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Identification and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is crucial. Patients with Cushing syndrome may have poorer outcomes because of the associated immunodeficiency and coagulopathy. Vitamin D deficiency appears to be associated with increased susceptibility or severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and replacement may improve outcomes. Robust strategies required for the optimal management of endocrinopathies in COVID-19 are discussed extensively in this mini-review.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Endocrine Society 2020.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04662437,Registry,9/10/2020,12/1/2020,Observational,The Status of Parathyroid Hormone Secretion in Covid-19 Patients,Completed,NA,Bezmialem Vakif University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04662437,0,2,2,0,NA,Turkey,0,0,Venous blood was collected for biochemistry testing,0,322,0.9816052556412453,0,0,0.9816052556412453

Outcomes were stratified according to elevated levels (ie, above the upper level of normal) of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or both measured within 24â€‰hours after hospital admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 397 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included up to 1 April 2020. At the time of hospital admission, 208 patients (52.4%) had normal values for cardiac biomarkers, 90 (22.7%) had elevated both hs-TnI and BNP, 59 (14.9%) had elevated only BNP and 40 (10.1%) had elevated only hs-TnI. The rate of mortality was higher in patients with elevated hs-TnI (22.5%, OR 4.35, 95%â€‰CI 1.72 to 11.04), BNP (33.9%, OR 7.37, 95%â€‰CI 3.53 to 16.75) or both (55.6%, OR 18.75, 95%â€‰CI 9.32 to 37.71) as compared with those without elevated cardiac biomarkers (6.25%). A multivariate analysis identified concomitant elevation of both hs-TnI and BNP as a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality (OR 3.24, 95%â€‰CI 1.06 to 9.93).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">An early detection of elevated hs-TnI and BNP predicts mortality in patients with COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers should be systematically assessed in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission in order to optimise risk stratification.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

To this end, we designed a prospective study (NCT04365322) that included 60 COVID-19 convalescent patients (1-month post infection) in two cohorts respectively entitled mild illness and severe pneumonia. The monitoring of peripheral immune responses was performed using IFNáµ§ ELISpot assay. The serology index of each patient was investigated at the same time. Patients with severe pneumonia were older and had more comorbidities than patients with mild illness. T-cell responses in term of frequency and intensity were clearly distinct between mild illness and severe pneumonia patients. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that recent history of COVID-19 did not hamper viral memory T-cell pool against common viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr-virus and Flu-virus). The presence of potent adaptive immunity even in patients who underwent severe pneumonia sustain the rationale for the development of protective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 The British Infection Association.

Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in &gt;5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0). Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">An easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""STUDY REGISTRATION"">ISRCTN66726260.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Twenty-nine patients recovered from COVID-19 as confirmed by negative nucleic tests for two consecutive times were recruited. A total of 29 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls were also recruited. The cognitive functions of all subjects were evaluated by the iPad-based online neuropsychological tests, including the Trail Making Test (TMT), Sign Coding Test (SCT), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and Digital Span Test (DST). Blood samples from all patients were collected for examining inflammatory profiles, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The relationship between cognitive functions and inflammatory profiles were analyzed by Pearson correlation. In results, although no significant differences were found in TMT, SCT, and DST between the two groups, patients with COVID-19 scored lower in the correct number of the second and third parts of CPT, they also scored higher in the missing number of the third part of CPT (all PÂ &lt;Â 0.05). In patients with COVID-19, there was a trend of significant difference for lower reaction time in the first and second parts of CPT (PÂ =Â 0.050, and 0.051, respectively), as well as the lower correct number of the second part of CPT (PÂ =Â 0.050). Correlation analysis showed that the reaction time for the first and second parts of CPT was positively correlated with the CRP levels (r = 0.557 and 0.410, PÂ &lt;Â 0.05).

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic?</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND FINDINGS"">We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3%-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%-37%, prediction interval 24%-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.</AbstractText>",NCT04742569,Registry,12/21/2020,6/30/2021,Observational,Wearable Diagnostic for Detection of COVID-19 Infection,Recruiting,NA,"ClinOne, Inc.",NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04742569,0,3,3,1,78142083,United States,0,1,NA,0,319,0.9817766352470723,0.5,0,2.4817766352470723

The cumulative incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in 25 peruvian regions is reported, together with its relationnship with altitude levels during March-July 2020 using PearsoÅ„s correlation. We also aiming to assess the prevalence of diabetes, obesity and hypertension with altitude according to the ENDES 2018 data using Gamma statistics. RESULTS: COVID-19 maintained an inverse correlation with higher rates in the coastal regions and lower rates with increasing altitude in the cumulative incidence (PearsonÂ =Â -0.8, pÂ &lt;Â 0.000) and mortality (PearsonÂ =Â -0.77, pÂ &lt;Â 0.000), adjusted gender and age.

The reduction in cumulative incidence and mortality rates with increasing altitude is the main finding. Possible mechanisms such as a decreased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and a lower virulence because of a high altitude environment, may explain this epidemiological features.

The link between neuropsychological functioning and the length of stay in the ICU suggests that neurocognitive rehabilitative treatments should be directed explicitly toward patients who treated in the ICU, rather than toward every patient who experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome owing to COVID-19. However, given the limitation of a case series study, those hypotheses should be tested with future studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up period.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (nâ€‰=â€‰54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever â‰¥38Â°C and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (nâ€‰=â€‰116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

Infectious diseases,"<AbstractText>The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally. An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, ""Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?""</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients taking statins were 11â€‰years older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients who were not taking statins. A genetic matching (GM) procedure was performed prior to analysis of the mortality risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the cause-specific hazard (CSH) function, and a competing-risks Fine and Gray (FG) model was also used to study the direct effects of statins on risk.Data from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed 2157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1234 men, 923 women; age: 67â€‰y/o (IQR 54-78)) admitted to the hospital were retrieved from the clinical records in anonymized manner. 353 deaths occurred. 581 patients were taking statins.

The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, headache and fatigue. However, atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported. Recently, a number of studies have recognized various mucocutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This study sought to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of the potential orofacial manifestations of COVID-19. An online literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to retrieve the relevant studies published up to July 2020. Original studies published in English that reported orofacial manifestations in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included; this yielded 16 articles involving 25 COVID-19-positive patients. The results showed a marked heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations. The most common orofacial manifestations were ulcerative lesions, vesiculobullous/macular lesions, and acute sialadentitis of the parotid gland (parotitis). In four cases, oral manifestations were the first signs of COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 may cause orofacial manifestations that might be the initial features in several cases. However, the occurrence of orofacial manifestations in COVID-19 seems to be underreported, mainly due to the lack of oral examination of patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19. Oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases is crucial for better understanding and documenting COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations.</AbstractText>",NCT04821986,Registry,4/1/2021,5/30/2021,Observational,Oral Manifestation in Patients With SARS-CoV2 Infection.,Recruiting,NA,Fayoum University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04821986,0,2,2,0,NA,Egypt,0,2,NA,0,280,0.984004570122822,0.5,0,1.484004570122822

The mechanisms of innate immunity, considered as the first line of antiviral defense, is essential towards viruses. A significant role in host defense of the lung, nasal and oral cavities is played by Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) HE4 has been demonstrated to be serum inflammatory biomarker and to show a role in natural immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract with both antimicrobial/antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Several biomarkers like IL-6, presepsin (PSP), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, D-Dimer have showed a good function as predictor factors for the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients (mild, severe and critical). The aim of this study was to correlate the blood levels of CRP, IL-6, PSP, PCT, D-Dimer with He4, to identify the predictive values of these biomarkers for the evolution of the disease and to evaluate the possible role of HE4 in the defense mechanisms of innate immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of Policlinico-University of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6 Â± 12.4 and 28 women age 65.7 Â± 15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4 Â± 7.7 and 6 women age 74.8 Â± 6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (<i>r</i> = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (<i>r</i> = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (<i>r</i> = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (<i>r</i> = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (<i>r</i> = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.</AbstractText>",NCT04840940,Registry,12/21/2020,12/21/2021,Observational,Presepsin Biomarker for Ventilator-associated Pneumonia Diagnosis in COVID-19 Patients,Recruiting,NA,San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04840940,0,19,19,0,NA,Italy,0,1,NA,0,261,0.9850899742930591,0.5,0,1.485089974293059

Many triggers have been identified, as stress, drugs, trauma, endocrine disease, nutritional deficiencies, and febrile states. We report three cases of TE occurred after severe Sars-Cov-2 infection and provide our clinical management, according to Sars-Cov-2 hygiene measures. Only one case report has been found in the literature associating anagen effluvium during severe Sars-Cov-2 infection. Other studies reported the exacerbation of a preexisting TE, correlated to the stress of lockdown. In our cases, patients never had a TE diagnosis before and did not report previous evident hair loss. TE can be associated with post severe Sars-Cov-2 infection. From our revision of the literature, this is the first case-series describing TE in post severe Sars-Cov-2 patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between TE and Sars-Cov-2 infection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04834102,Registry,1/27/2021,4/27/2021,Observational,COVID-19 Induced Telogen Effluvium,Recruiting,NA,Istanbul Medeniyet University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04834102,0,2,2,0,NA,Turkey,0,0,Blood Tests,0,171,0.9902313624678664,0,0,0.9902313624678664

Furthermore, mobile applications that accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on 2745 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 to September 11, 2020, consisting of PCR positive tests conducted between February 16 and September 9. Considering male (female) participants, 11.9% (11.2%) of the participants were asymptomatic, 48.3% (47.8%) recovered at home by themselves, 29.7% (33.7%) recovered at home with the help of someone else, 9.3% (6.6%) required hospitalization without ventilation, and 0.5% (0.4%) required ventilation. There were a total of 21 symptoms reported, and the prevalence of symptoms varies by sex. Fever was present in 59.4% of male subjects and in 52% of female subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.82â€‰Â±â€‰0.017 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77â€‰Â±â€‰0.018 for the prediction of illness on a specific day. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while HRV is decreased.

33322316,Journal Article|Review, , ,Could Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Be an Effective Treatment for Long COVID and Post COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome? Lessons from the Qure Study for Q-Fever Fatigue Syndrome.,2020-12-29,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","<AbstractText>An increasing number of young and previously fit and healthy people who did not require hospitalisation continue to have symptoms months after mild cases of COVID-19. Rehabilitation clinics are already offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome based on the claims that it is effective for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)-the most common post-infectious syndrome-as no study into the efficacy of CBT for post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome has been published. Re-analyses of these studies, however, showed that CBT did not lead to objective improvements in heterogeneous groups of ME/CFS patients, nor did it restore the ability to work. The group of patients with long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, on the other hand, is homogeneous. We therefore analysed the Dutch Qure study, as it studied the efficacy of CBT in a homogeneous group of patients who developed Q-fever fatigue syndrome-which affects up to 30% of patients-after the largest reported outbreak of Q-fever, to see if CBT might potentially be an effective treatment for long-haulers after COVID-19 infection. Our reanalysis found that the Qure study suffered from many serious methodological problems, which included relying on one subjective primary outcome in a study without a control group for the non-blinded CBT treatment group, using a post hoc definition of improvement, waiting 2 years before publishing their objective actometer results and ignoring the null effect of said results. Moreover, only 10% of participants achieved a clinically meaningful subjective improvement in fatigue as a result of CBT according to the study's own figures. Consequently, CBT has no subjective clinically meaningful effect in nine out of every ten patients that are treated with it. Additionally, the subjective improvement in fatigue was not matched by an improvement in disability, even though the disability was fatigue related according to the researchers. On top of this, CBT did not lead to an objective improvement in physical performance. Therefore, it cannot be said that CBT is an effective treatment for Q-fever fatigue syndrome either. It seems therefore unlikely that CBT will reduce disability or lead to objective improvement in long COVID or in post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome.</AbstractText>",NCT04987853,Registry,6/1/2021,12/1/2022,Observational,"Clinical, Functional, Immunological and Genetic Factors on the Severity of the Course of Coronavirus Infection",Recruiting,NA,"National Research Center for Cardiac Surgery, Kazakhstan",NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04987853,0,12,12,0,NA,Kazakhstan,0,0,Clinical and functional analysis|Neurological analysis|Immunological analysis:|Genetic analysis:,0,230,0.9868608968866038,0,0,0.9868608968866038

Two aspects were specifically considered: 1) reported changes in intake of specific food categories and 2) effect on healthy eating, operationalized as adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS score). Respondents (<i>N</i> = 2,462) completed a 44-items self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of their socio-demographic characteristics, general food habits, and consumption frequency of selected foods (mainly related to the MedDiet) during the lockdown. The data indicated that the lockdown has affected dietary habits of adult Danes to a relatively limited degree. The most important findings were that a substantial proportion of respondents (â‰¥28%) reported eating more, snacking more, exercising less, and gaining weight during the lockdown. Results could be linked to the amount of time spent at home (e.g., a higher cooking frequency) a higher degree of emotional eating during the lockdown (e.g., a higher consumption of pastries and alcohol). Women were generally affected to a higher degree than men. Additionally, dietary changes during the lockdown to a certain degree reflected pre-existing (un)healthy eating habits, as positive health outcomes were observed in respondents with a high MEDAS score and negative outcomes (e.g., weight gain and higher intakes of pastries and carbonated beverages) were associated with respondents with a low MEDAS score. These changes, if sustained long-term, are potentially concerning from a public health perspective, especially given that more than half of the respondents were characterized by a low adherence to the MedDiet.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Giacalone, FrÃ¸st and RodrÃ­guez-PÃ©rez.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04449731,Registry,3/20/2020,8/30/2020,Observational,Changes in Dietary Behaviours During the COVID-19 Outbreak Confinement in the Adult Population (COVIDiet_Int),Recruiting,NA,Universidad de Granada,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04449731,0,3,3,0,NA,Spain,0,4,NA,0,230,0.9868608968866038,1,0,1.9868608968866037

Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 212 to 354), regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 96% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 15, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower in cohort 3.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further development of this vaccine candidate.

33521007,Journal Article|Review, , ,Association of Viral Infections With Oral Cavity Lesions: Role of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,2021-02-02,Frontiers in medicine,"<AbstractText>Different viral agents, such as herpesviruses, human papillomavirus, and Coxsackie virus, are responsible for primary oral lesions, while other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, affect the oral cavity due to immune system weakness. Interestingly, it has been reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can show cutaneous manifestations, including the oral cavity. However, the association between oral injuries and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still unclear. This narrative review aimed to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of oral lesions associated with COVID-19. An online literature search was conducted to select relevant studies published up to November 2020. The results of 17 studies showed variability in oral lesions associated with COVID-19, including ulcerations, aphthous-like lesions, and macules. The tongue, lips, and palate were the most frequent anatomical locations. According to current knowledge, the etiopathogenesis of multiple COVID-19-associated lesions seems to be multifactorial. The appearance of such lesions could be related to the direct or indirect action of SARS-CoV-2 over the oral mucosa cells, coinfections, immunity impairment, and adverse drug reactions. Nevertheless, COVID-19-associated oral lesions may be underreported, mainly due to lockdown periods and the lack of mandatory dispositive protection. Consequently, further research is necessary to determine the diagnostic and pathological significance of oral manifestations of COVID-19. All medical doctors, dentists, and dermatologists are encouraged to perform an accurate and thorough oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to recognize the disease's possible early manifestations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 La Rosa, Libra, De Pasquale, Ferlito and PedullÃ .</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04821986,Registry,4/1/2021,5/30/2021,Observational,Oral Manifestation in Patients With SARS-CoV2 Infection.,Recruiting,NA,Fayoum University,NA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04821986,0,2,2,0,NA,Egypt,0,2,NA,0,195,0.988860325621251,0.5,0,1.4888603256212511
