Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1Â·84, 95% CI 1Â·53-2Â·21), male sex (1Â·63, 1Â·07-2Â·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1Â·60, 1Â·03-2Â·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4Â·50, 1Â·33-15Â·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3Â·89, 2Â·11-7Â·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5Â·20, 2Â·77-9Â·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2Â·93, 1Â·79-4Â·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0Â·24, 0Â·07-0Â·84) or the US-Midwest (0Â·50, 0Â·28-0Â·90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer.

Also, age and multimorbidity might be confounders. No sufficient data are available to demonstrate their independent role. We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to verify whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are related to COVID-19 severe outcomes. We analyzed information from Italian patients diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted in 26 hospitals. One thousand five hundred ninety-one charts (male, 64.1%; 66Â±0.4 years) were recorded. At least 1 preexisting condition was observed in 73.4% of patients, with hypertension being the most represented (54.9%). One hundred eighty-eight deaths were recorded (11.8%; mean age, 79.6Â±0.9 years). In nonsurvivors, older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure were more represented than in survivors. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (4.3Â±0.15 versus 2.6Â±0.05; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, diuretics, and Î²-blockers were more frequently used in nonsurvivors than in survivors.

Charlson Comorbidity Index, which cumulates age and comorbidities, predicts mortality with an exponential increase in the odds ratio by each point of score. In the COVID-19 outbreak, mortality is predicted by age and the presence of comorbidities.

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has also been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

However, scarce clinical data is available and generally limited to the Chinese population due to the first cases were identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China).This article describes the rationale and design of the HOPE COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID 19) registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04334291). With an ambispective cohort design, eligible patients are those discharged, deceased or alive, from any hospital center with a confirmed diagnosis or a COVID-19 high suspicion. With a current recruitment of more than 7000 cases, in 46 hospitals in 8 countries, since it is not possible to estimate the sample size based on literature reports, the investigators will try to get the maximum numbers of patients possible. The study primary objective is all cause mortality and aims to characterize the clinical profile of patients infected in order to develop a prognostic clinical score allowing, rapid logistic decision making. As secondary objectives, the analysis of other clinical events, the risk-adjusted influence of treatments and previous comorbidities of patients infected with the disease will be performed.The results of HOPE COVID-19 will contribute to a better understanding of this condition. We aim to describe the management of this condition as well as the outcomes in relation to the therapy chosen, in order to gain insight into improving patient care in the coming months.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Clinical Trial registration"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">ClinicalTrials.gov.

In the death-multivariate analysis, raised as most relevant: age, hypertension, obesity, renal insufficiency, any immunosuppressive disease, 02 saturationâ€‰&lt;â€‰92% and an elevated C reactive protein (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.87; Hosmer-Lemeshow test, pâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.999; bootstrap-optimist: 0.0018). We provide a simple clinical score to estimate probability of death, dividing patients in four grades (I-IV) of increasing probability. Hydroxychloroquine (79.2%) and antivirals (67.6%) were the specific drugs most commonly used. After a propensity score adjustment, the results suggested a slight improvement in mortality rates (adjusted-OR<sub>hydroxychloroquine</sub> 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.91, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005; adjusted-OR<sub>antiviral</sub> 0.94; 95% CI 0.87-1.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.115). COVID-19 produces important mortality, mostly in patients with comorbidities with respiratory symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine could be associated with survival benefit, but this data need to be confirmed with further trials.

Using rapid literature review, we identified signs and symptoms which are commoner in severe COVID-19. Building a preliminary set of items from these, we ran four rounds of an online Delphi panel with 72 clinicians, the last incorporating fictional vignettes, collating data on R software. We refined the items iteratively in response to quantitative and qualitative feedback. Items in the penultimate round were checked against narrative interviews with 50 COVID-19 patients. We required, for each item, at least 80% clinician agreement on relevance, wording and cut-off values, and that the item addressed issues and concerns raised by patients.

SARS-COV2 (Severe-acute-respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus-type 2) pneumonia can be fatal. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether admittance dysnatremia is associated with mortality, sepsis, or intensive therapy (IT) in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia. This is a retrospective study of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry, with data collected from January 1<sup>th</sup> through April 31<sup>th</sup>, 2020. We selected all hospitalized adult patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-COV2 pneumonia and a registered admission serum sodium level (SNa). Patients were classified as hyponatremic (SNa &lt;135 mmol/L), eunatremic (SNa 135-145 mmol/L), or hypernatremic (SNa &gt;145 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate independent relationships of admission hyponatremia and hypernatremia, with mortality, sepsis, or IT during hospitalization. Four thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, median age 66 (52-77), 58% males. Death occurred in 988 (21.2%) patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 551 (12%) and IT in 838 (18.4%). Hyponatremia was present in 957/4,664 (20.5%) patients, and hypernatremia in 174/4,664 (3.7%). Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia were associated with mortality and sepsis. Only hyponatremia was associated with IT. In conclusion, hyponatremia and hypernatremia at admission are factors independently associated with mortality and sepsis in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Clinical Trial Registration"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334291, NCT04334291.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Ruiz-SÃ¡nchez, NÃºÃ±ez-Gil, Cuesta, Rubio, Maroun-Eid, Arroyo-Espliguero, Romero, Becerra-MuÃ±oz, Uribarri, Feltes, Trabattoni, Molina, GarcÃ­a Aguado, Pepe, Cerrato, Alfonso, Castro MejÃ­a, Roubin, BuzÃ³n, Bondia, Marin, LÃ³pez Pais, Abumayyaleh, Dâ€™Ascenzo, Rondano, Huang, Fernandez-Perez, Macaya, de Miguel Novoa, Calle-Pascual, Estrada Perez, Runkle and HOPE COVID-19 investigators.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04334291,Abstract,3/23/2020,5/1/2020,Observational [Patient Registry],"International COVID19 Clinical Evaluation Registry,",Completed,NA,"St Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33329400,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334291,8,18,26,0,Spain,0,4,Observational (registry),NA,0

Additionally, the fear of COVID-19 contagion delays the consultation of patients, resulting in the deterioration of their acute diseases by the time of consultation. In the specific case of urgent digestive surgery patients, both factors significantly worsen the postoperative course and prognosis. Main working hypothesis: infection by COVID-19 increases postoperative 30-day-mortality for any cause in patients submitted to emergency/urgent general or gastrointestinal surgery. Likewise, hospital collapse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic increased 30-day-mortality for any cause. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30-days-after-surgery. Secondary objectives are: to estimate the cumulative incidence of postoperative complications and to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for COVID-19-infected patients.A multicenter, observational retrospective cohort study (COVID-CIR-study) will be carried out in consecutive patients operated on for urgent digestive pathology. Two cohorts will be defined: the ""pandemic"" cohort, which will include all patients (classified as COVID-19-positive or -negative) operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2020; and the ""control"" cohort, which will include all patients operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2019. Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics, clinical and analytical parameters, scores on the usual prognostic scales for quality management in a General Surgery service (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and LUCENTUM scores), prognostic factors applicable to all patients, specific prognostic factors for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, postoperative morbidity and mortality (at 30 and 90 postoperative days). The main objective is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30â€Šdays after surgery. As secondary objectives, to estimate the cumulative incidence of postoperative complications and to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.The protocol (version1.0, April 20th 2020) was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Ethic-and-Clinical-Investigation-Committee, code PR169/20, date 05/05/20).

We assessed the risks associated with cardiometabolic factors for severe COVID-19 when accounting for socioeconomic factors and in subgroups by age, sex and region of birth.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"">In this nationwide case-control study, 1.086 patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (cases), and 10.860 population-based controls matched for age, sex and district of residency were included from mandatory national registries. ORs with 95% CIs for associations between severe COVID-19 and exposures with adjustment for confounders were estimated using logistic regression. The median age was 62 years (IQR 52-70), and 3003 (24.9%) were women. Type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.7)), hypertension (OR, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0)), obesity (OR, 3.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.0)) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.7)) were all associated with severe COVID-19. In the younger subgroup (below 57 years), ORs were significantly higher for all cardiometabolic risk factors.

The Spanish government has enforced social distancing, quarantine, and home confinement measures. Such restrictions on activities of daily life and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with health-related consequences among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, inadequate access to health care and social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Home-based technological interventions have emerged for combating social isolation and loneliness, while simultaneously preventing the risk of virus exposure.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this cohort study is to explore, analyze, and determine the impact of social isolation on (1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and on the caregiver burden; (2) access to and utilization of health and social care services; and (3) cognitive, social, and entertainment-related uses of information and communication technologies.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This study will be conducted in MÃ¡laga (AndalucÃ­a, Spain). In total 200 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and his/her informal caregiver, will be contacted by telephone. Potential respondents will be participants of the following clinical trials: support, monitoring, and reminder technology for mild dementia (n=100) and television-based assistive integrated service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n=100).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">As of May 2021, a total of 153 participants have been enrolled and assessed during COVID-19 confinement, of whom 67 have been assessed at 6 months of enrollment. Changes in the mean values of the variables will be analyzed relative to baseline findings of previous studies with those during and after confinement, using repeated-measures analysis of variance or the nonparametric Friedman test, as appropriate. The performance of multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to introduce potential covariates will also be considered. Values of 95% CI will be used.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">If our hypothesis is accepted, these findings will demonstrate the negative impact of social isolation owing to COVID-19 confinement on cognition, quality of life, mood, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia, the impact on technophilia, caregiver burden, the access to and utilization of health and social care services, and the cognitive, social, and entertainment-related use of information and communication technologies during and after COVID-19 confinement.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04385797; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04385797.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID)"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/26431.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â©Jessica Marian Goodman-Casanova, Elena Dura-Perez, Gloria Guerrero-PertiÃ±ez, Pilar Barnestein-Fonseca, Jose Guzman-Parra, Amanda Vega-NuÃ±ez, Esperanza Varela-Moreno, Antonio Cuesta-Vargas, Fermin Mayoral-Cleries.

Currently, there is no indication as to whether individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be vaccinated, or whether they should receive 1 or 2 vaccine doses.METHODSWe tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 health care professionals, of whom 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with or without symptoms.RESULTSPostvaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5 to 18 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (P &lt; 0.0001). In a multivariate linear regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG prevaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those who voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain, and fever markedly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose.CONCLUSIONOne vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies, suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04387929.FUNDINGDolce &amp; Gabbana and the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca corrente).</AbstractText>",NCT04387929,Abstract,5/4/2020,5/30/2021,Observational [Patient Registry],Detection of Anti-COVID-19 Antibody Levels in an Hospital Population,Recruiting,NA,Istituto Clinico Humanitas,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33956667,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04387929,1,0,1,0,Italy,0,1,Detection of anti-COVID-19 antibody level,NA,0

We tested whether COVID-19 patients on chronic oral anticoagulants (cOACs) for thromboembolism prophylaxis could receive protection from developing more severe phenotypes of the disease. <b>Approach and Results:</b> We searched the database of the SARS-RAS study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04331574), a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy designed by the Italian Society of Hypertension. The database counts 2,377 charts of Italian COVID-19 patients in 26 hospitals. We calculated the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), which is associated with death in COVID-19 patients. In our population (<i>n</i> = 2,377, age 68.2 Â± 0.4 years, CCI: 3.04 Â± 0.04), we confirm that CCI is associated with increased mortality [OR: 1.756 (1.628-1.894)], admission to intensive care units [ICU; OR: 1.074 (1.017-1.134)], and combined hard events [CHE; OR: 1.277 (1.215-1.342)]. One hundred twenty-five patients were on cOACs (age: 79.3 Â± 0.9 years, CCI: 4.35 Â± 0.13); despite the higher CCI, cOACs patients presented with a lower risk of admissions to the ICU [OR 0.469 (0.250-0.880)] but not of death [OR: 1.306 (0.78-2.188)] or CHE [OR: 0.843 (0.541-1.312)]. In multivariable logistic regression, cOACs confirmed their protective effect on ICU admission and CHE. The CCI remains the most important risk factor for ICU admission, death, and CHE. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data support a mechanism for the continuation of cOAC therapy after hospital admission for those patients who are on chronic treatment. Our preliminary results suggest the prophylactic use of direct cOACs in patients with elevated CCI score at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic even in absence of other risks of thromboembolism.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Iaccarino, Grassi, Borghi, Grassi, Mancusi, Muiesan, Salvetti, Volpe and Ferri.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04331574,Abstract,3/10/2020,4/10/2020,Observational [Patient Registry],Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors and COVID-19,Recruiting,NA,Societa Italiana dell'Ipertensione Arteriosa,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34055928,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04331574,3,0,3,0,Italy,0,0,NA,NA,0

Lung-protective ventilation was widely used and median duration of ventilation was 13 days (IQR 7-22). Median tidal volume was 6Â·1 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 6Â·0-7Â·0) on day 1, and the value increased significantly up to day 7; positive end-expiratory pressure was 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (8-12) on day 1, with a slight but significant decrease to day 7. Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) was 160 (IQR 111-218), respiratory system compliance 36 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O (29-44), driving pressure 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (10-14), and FiO<sub>2</sub> 0Â·60 (0Â·45-0Â·80) on day 1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 1672 (87Â·6%) of patients; 1176 (61Â·6%) received prone positioning. In-hospital mortality was 57Â·7% (1101/1909 patients) and ICU mortality was 57Â·0% (1088/1909 patients); 462 (43Â·8%) patients died of refractory hypoxaemia, frequently overlapping with septic shock (n=174). Cox regression identified age (hazard ratio 1Â·02 [95% CI 1Â·01-1Â·03]), Charlson score (1Â·16 [1Â·11-1Â·23]), endotracheal intubation outside of the ICU (ie, before ICU admission; 1Â·37 [1Â·10-1Â·71]), vasopressor use on day 1 (1Â·29 [1Â·07-1Â·55]), D-dimer concentration (1Â·02 [1Â·01-1Â·03]), PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> on day 1 (0Â·998 [0Â·997-0Â·999]), arterial pH on day 1 (1Â·01 [1Â·00-1Â·01]), driving pressure on day 1 (1Â·05 [1Â·03-1Â·08]), acute kidney injury (1Â·66 [1Â·36-2Â·03]), and month of admission (1Â·10 [1Â·03-1Â·18]) as independent predictors of mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">In patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation, lung-protective ventilation was widely used but mortality was high.

To monitor disease development over time with respect to critically ill COVID-19 patients, we report near real-time prospective observational data from the RISC-19-ICU registry that indicate changed characteristics of critically ill patients admitted to Swiss intensive care units (ICUs) at the onset of a third pandemic wave.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">1829 of 3344 critically ill COVID-19 patients enrolled in the international RISC-19-ICU registry as of 31 May 2021 were treated in Switzerland and were included in the present study. Of these, 1690 patients were admitted to the ICU before 1 February 2021 and were compared with 139 patients admitted during the emerging third pandemic wave RESULTS: Third wave patients were a mean of 5.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2&amp;ndash;7.1) younger (median 66.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 57.0&amp;ndash;73.0 vs 62.0 years, IQR 54.5&amp;ndash;68.0; p &amp;lt;0.0001) and had a higher body mass index than patients admitted in the previous pandemic period. They presented with lower SAPS II and APACHE II scores, less need for circulatory support and lower white blood cell counts at ICU admission. P/F ratio was similar, but a 14% increase in ventilatory ratio was observed over time (p = 0.03) CONCLUSION: Near real-time registry data show that the latest COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in Switzerland at the onset of the third wave were on average 5 years younger, had a higher body mass index, and presented with lower physiological risk scores but a trend towards more severe lung failure. These differences may primarily be related to the ongoing nationwide vaccination campaign, but the possibility that changes in virus-host interactions may be a co-factor in the age shift and change in disease characteristics is cause for concern, and should be taken into account in the public health and vaccination strategy during the ongoing pandemic.

The RECAP (Remote COVID-19 Assessment in Primary Care) study investigates the predictive risk of hospitalization, deterioration, and death of patients with confirmed COVID-19, based on a set of parameters chosen through a Delphi process performed by clinicians. We aim to use rich data collected remotely through the use of electronic data templates integrated in the electronic health systems of several general practices across the United Kingdom to construct accurate predictive models. The models will be based on preexisting conditions and monitoring data of a patient's clinical parameters (eg, blood oxygen saturation) to make reliable predictions as to the patient's risk of hospital admission, deterioration, and death.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">This statistical analysis plan outlines the statistical methods to build the prediction model to be used in the prioritization of patients in the primary care setting. The statistical analysis plan for the RECAP study includes the development and validation of the RECAP-V1 prediction model as a primary outcome. This prediction model will be adapted as a three-category risk score split into red (high risk), amber (medium risk), and green (low risk) for any patient with suspected COVID-19. The model will predict the risk of deterioration and hospitalization.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">After the data have been collected, we will assess the degree of missingness and use a combination of traditional data imputation using multiple imputation by chained equations, as well as more novel machine-learning approaches to impute the missing data for the final analysis. For predictive model development, we will use multiple logistic regression analyses to construct the model. We aim to recruit a minimum of 1317 patients for model development and validation. We will then externally validate the model on an independent dataset of 1400 patients. The model will also be applied for multiple different datasets to assess both its performance in different patient groups and its applicability for different methods of data collection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">As of May 10, 2021, we have recruited 3732 patients.

Healthy controls without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were also enrolled at least 4 weeks after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. All study participants received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a history of anti-CD20 treatment who showed a humoral immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in comparison with immunocompetent controls. Prespecified secondary endpoints were the effect of anti-CD20 therapy (including time since last treatment and cumulative dose) on humoral or cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and biomarkers of immunocompetence.

In this context, we evaluated the humoral response by determining the titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia (WM) after vaccination with the BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccine. A US Food and Drug Administration-approved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methodology was implemented to evaluate NAbs on the day of the first vaccine shot, as well as on days 22 and 50 afterward. A total of 106 patients with WM (43% men; median age, 73 years) and 212 healthy controls (46% men; median age, 66 years) who were vaccinated during the same period at the same center were enrolled in the study (which is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04743388). Our data indicate that vaccination with either 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or 1 dose of the AZD1222 vaccine leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM compared with controls on days 22 and 50 (P &lt; .001 for all comparisons). Disease-related immune dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression are involved in the low humoral response. Importantly, active treatment with either rituximab or Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors was proven as an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response after vaccination. In conclusion, patients with WM have low humoral response after COVID-19 vaccination, which underlines the need for timely vaccination ideally during a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Healthy subjects and severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intermediate respiratory (IRCU) and intensive care units (ICU) due to hypoxemia were studied. Local tissue/blood oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>) and local hemoglobin concentration (THC) were non-invasively measured on the forearm by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A vascular occlusion test (VOT), a three-minute induced ischemia, was performed in order to obtain dynamic StO<sub>2</sub> parameters: deoxygenation rate (DeO<sub>2</sub>), reoxygenation rate (ReO<sub>2</sub>), and hyperemic response (H<sub>AUC</sub>).

Aim of this study is to evaluate how COVID-19 influenced the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of surgical pancreatic diseases. A comparative analysis of surgical volumes and clinical, surgical and perioperative outcomes in ten Italian referral centers was conducted between the first semester 2020 and 2019. One thousand four hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the analysis: 638 from 2020 and 785 from 2019. Surgical volume in 2020 decreased by 18.7% (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001). Benign/precursors diseases (-â€‰43.4%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) and neuroendocrine tumors (-â€‰33.6%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) were the less treated diseases. No difference was reported in terms of discussed cases at the multidisciplinary tumor board (pâ€‰=â€‰0.43), mean time between diagnosis and neoadjuvant treatment (pâ€‰=â€‰0.91), indication to surgery and surgical resection (pâ€‰=â€‰0.35).

No difference was documented for post-operative intensive care unit accesses (pâ€‰=â€‰0.23) and post-operative mortality (pâ€‰=â€‰0.06). The surgical volume decrease in 2020 will potentially lead, in the near future, to the diagnosis of a higher rate of advanced stage diseases.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data about myocardial injury in children are limited to small cohorts. The aim of this multicenter, international registry is to describe clinical and cardiac characteristics of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 using CMR so as to better understand the real extent of myocardial damage in this vulnerable cohort.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"">Hundred-eleven patients meeting the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), having clinical cardiac involvement and having received CMR imaging scan were included from 17 centers. Median age at disease onset was 10.0Â years (IQR 7.0-13.8). The majority of children had COVID-19 serology positive (98%) with 27% of children still having both, positive serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CMR was performed at a median of 28Â days (19-47) after onset of symptoms. Twenty out of 111 (18%) patients had CMR criteria for acute myocarditis (as defined by the Lake Louise Criteria) with 18/20 showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). CMR myocarditis was significantly associated with New York Heart Association class IV (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005, OR 6.56 (95%-CI 1.87-23.00)) and the need for mechanical support (pâ€‰=â€‰0.039, OR 4.98 (95%-CI 1.18-21.02)). At discharge, 11/111 (10%) patients still had left ventricular systolic dysfunction.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">No CMR evidence of myocardial damage was found in most of our MIS-C cohort. Nevertheless, acute myocarditis is a possible manifestation of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 with CMR evidence of myocardial necrosis in 18% of our cohort.

34985974,Journal Article, , ,Nanobody-Functionalized Cellulose for Capturing SARS-CoV-2.,2022-01-05,Applied and environmental microbiology,"<AbstractText>The highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 253 million people, claiming âˆ¼ 5.1 million lives to date. Although mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and vaccinations help curb viral transmission, there is a pressing need for cost-effective systems to mitigate the viral spread. Here, we present a generic strategy for capturing SARS-CoV-2 through functionalized cellulose materials. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody (Nb) targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose to capture viruses from complex fluids in a continuous fashion. By capturing and containing viruses through the Nb-functionalized cellulose, our work may find utilities in virus sampling and filtration towards paper-based diagnostics, environmental tracking of viral spread and reducing viral load from infected individuals. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic center around the development of diagnostics, preventative measures, and therapeutic strategies. In comparison to existing work, we have provided a complementary strategy to capture SARS-CoV-2 by functionalized cellulose materials towards paper-based diagnostics as well as virus filtration in perishable samples. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of both a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody specific for the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, the fusion protein-coated cellulose substrates exhibited enhanced capture efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of both wildtype and the D614G mutant variants, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography for binding viruses from complex biological fluids in a highly continuous and cost-effective manner. Such antigen-specific capture can potentially immobilize viruses of interest for viral detection and removal, which contrasts with the common size- or affinity-based filtration devices that bind a broad range of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and cytokines present in blood (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04413955). Additionally, since our work focuses on capturing and concentrating viruses from surfaces and fluids as a means to improve detection, it can serve as an ""add-on"" technology to complement existing viral detection methods, many of which have been largely focusing on improving the intrinsic sensitivities.</AbstractText>",NCT04413955,Abstract,6/1/2020,12/31/2022,Observational [Patient Registry],Registry of SeraphÂ®-100 MicrobindÂ® Affinity Blood Filter for COVID-19 Under EUA,Enrolling by invitation,NA,"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985974,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04413955,1,0,1,1,United States,0,3,SeraphÂ®-100 MicrobindÂ® Affinity Blood Filter,NA,0

The multicenter CTC Registry was established to systematically collect patient-level data, outcomes, and utilization patterns of CytoSorb under the EUA. <b>Methods:</b> Patient-level data was entered retrospectively at participating centers. The primary outcome of the registry was ICU mortality. Patient disposition of death, continuing ICU care, or ICU discharge was analyzed up to Day 90 after start of CytoSorb therapy. Demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 medications, inflammatory biomarkers, and details on CytoSorb use were compared between survivors and non-survivors in the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cohort. <b>Results:</b> Between April 2020 and April 2021, 52 patients received veno-venous ECMO plus CytoSorb therapy at 5 U.S. centers. ICU mortality was 17.3% (9/52) on day 30, 26.9% (14/52) on day 90, and 30.8% (16/52) at final follow-up of 153 days. Survivors had a trend toward lower baseline D-Dimer levels (2.3 Â± 2.5 vs. 19.8 Â± 32.2 Î¼g/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.056) compared to non-survivors. A logistic regression analysis suggested a borderline association between baseline D-Dimer levels and mortality with a 32% increase in the risk of death per 1 Î¼g/mL increase (<i>p</i> = 0.055). CytoSorb was well-tolerated without any device-related adverse events reported. <b>Conclusions:</b> CytoSorb therapy for critically ill COVID-19 patients on ECMO was associated with high survival rates suggesting potential therapeutic benefit. Elevated baseline D-Dimer levels may suggest increased risk of mortality. Prospective controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0439192, identifier: NCT04391920.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Song, Hayanga, Durham, Garrison, McCarthy, Barksdale, Smith, Bartlett, Jaros, Nelson, Molnar, Deliargyris and Moazami.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04391920,Abstract,8/28/2020,1/20/2022,Observational [Patient Registry],Registry of CytoSorb Therapy in COVID-19 ICU Patients,Completed,NA,"CytoSorbents, Inc",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988092,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04391920,1,0,1,1,United States,0,6,CytoSorb 300 mL device,NA,0

To fill knowledge gaps on the course and prognosis of neonatal cases, we analyzed 1-year data from the Turkish Neonatal Society in this prospective cohort study of neonates with postnatal transmission. Data from 44 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), of neonates with positive RT-PCR results at days 5-28 of life, were extracted from the online registry system and analyzed. Of 176 cases, most were term infants with normal birth weight. Fever was the most common symptom (64.2%), followed by feeding intolerance (25.6%), and cough (21.6%). The median length of hospitalization was 9Â days, with approximately one quarter of infants receiving some type of ventilatory support. Myocarditis (5.7%) was the most common complication during follow-up. Among the clinical findings, cough (odds ratio [OR]: 9.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.17-21.71), tachypnea (OR: 26.5, 95% CI: 9.59-73.19), and chest retractions (OR: 27.5, 95% CI: 5.96-126.96) were associated with more severe clinical disease. Also, there were significant differences in the C-reactive protein level, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, and days in the NICU (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, pâ€‰=â€‰0.012, pâ€‰=â€‰0.034, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008, and pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001, respectively) between patients with mild-moderate and severe-critical presentations. A PT above 14Â s was a significant predictor of severe/critical cases, with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 73%.Conclusions: Our data showed that late-onset COVID-19 infection in neonates who need hospitalization can be severe, showing associations with high rates of ventilatory support and myocarditis. Cough, tachypnea, and retractions on admission suggest a severe disease course.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:Â NCT04401540. What is Known: â€¢ Neonatal cases of COVID-19 infection are mainly reported as perinatal COVID-19 cases. â€¢ Neonates with perinatal transmission have a mild course and favorable prognosis. What is New: â€¢ Among symptomatic neonates with late-onset COVID-19 infection, fever was the most common symptom, and almost one quarter of hospitalized cases needed some type of respiratory support. Myocarditis was the most common complication. â€¢ The presence of cough, tachypnea, retractions, and a PT above 14 s were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2022.

21475695,Journal Article, , ,An overview of sarcopenia: facts and numbers on prevalence and clinical impact.,2021-10-20,"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle","<AbstractText>Human muscle undergoes constant changes. After about age 50, muscle mass decreases at an annual rate of 1-2%. Muscle strength declines by 1.5% between ages 50 and 60 and by 3% thereafter. The reasons for these changes include denervation of motor units and a net conversion of fast type II muscle fibers into slow type I fibers with resulting loss in muscle power necessary for activities of daily living. In addition, lipids are deposited in the muscle, but these changes do not usually lead to a loss in body weight. Once muscle mass in elderly subjects falls below 2 standard deviations of the mean of a young control cohort and the gait speed falls below 0.8Â m/s, a clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia can be reached. Assessment of muscle strength using tests such as the short physical performance battery test, the timed get-up-and-go test, or the stair climb power test may also be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Sarcopenia is one of the four main reasons for loss of muscle mass. On average, it is estimated that 5-13% of elderly people aged 60-70Â years are affected by sarcopenia. The numbers increase to 11-50% for those aged 80 or above. Sarcopenia may lead to frailty, but not all patients with sarcopenia are frail-sarcopenia is about twice as common as frailty. Several studies have shown that the risk of falls is significantly elevated in subjects with reduced muscle strength. Treatment of sarcopenia remains challenging, but promising results have been obtained using progressive resistance training, testosterone, estrogens, growth hormone, vitamin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Interesting nutritional interventions include high-caloric nutritional supplements and essential amino acids that support muscle fiber synthesis.</AbstractText>",NCT04780126,Registry,2/26/2021,4/30/2021,Observational [Patient Registry],Sarco-COVID Study: Measuring the Loss of Skeletal Muscle Mass in the Hospitalized Patient With the Diagnosis of COVID-19,Recruiting,NA,Fundacion para la Investigacion Biomedica del Hospital Universitario la Paz,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21475695,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780126,0,5,5,0,Spain,0,0,Sarcopenia diagnosis,NA,0

In vitro studies have suggested adverse effects of OPEs on the kidney. Despite accumulating evidence indicating widespread exposure to OPEs, their association with renal function in humans has not been evaluated. This study aims to investigate the association between OPEs exposure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) among the general US adult population by employing data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014. Among 1578 adults who were not currently pregnant, the associations of the urinary OPE metabolites with two CKD-related parameters, i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and CKD were assessed. To account for urine dilution, in addition to conventional creatinine-adjustment, covariate-adjusted creatinine standardization, which controls for potential confounding by kidney function, was employed. Multi-pollutant models were also constructed to verify the associations observed in the models on individual OPE metabolites. The urinary bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP) level was negatively associated with eGFR only with the covariate-adjusted standardization method, but not with the conventional creatinine adjustment. In addition, both bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP) were positively associated with the ACR, regardless of methods of urine dilution adjustment. These three compounds were also associated with CKD. Following adjusting urine dilution with the covariate-adjusted standardization method, the association became more evident. Moreover, similar results were observed in the secondary analysis with the multi-pollutant models. Among the US general population, several OPEs were identified as potential chemical determinants of CKD. Experimental studies are warranted to understand the potential mechanisms underlying this observation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

We applied ""projections"" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days Â± 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days Â± 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.

Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64Â·6 years [11Â·2] vs 51Â·9 years [12Â·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.

American journal of roentgenology,"<AbstractText><b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). <b>RESULTS.</b> Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.</AbstractText>",NCT04661631,Registry,5/8/2020,7/31/2021,Observational [Patient Registry],Surgery and Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19 Infection,Recruiting,NA,Fundacion Clinica Valle del Lili,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125873,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04661631,0,24,24,0,Colombia,0,2,Lung ultrasound,NA,0

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.

Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1Â·0â€‰Ã—â€‰10â¹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.

Purpose To describe the time course and severity of findings of COVID-19 at chest radiography and correlate these with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 confirmed by using RT-PCR and chest radiographic examinations who were admitted across four hospitals and evaluated between January and March 2020. Baseline and serial chest radiographs (<i>n</i> = 255) were reviewed with RT-PCR. Correlation with concurrent CT examinations (<i>n</i> = 28) was performed when available. Two radiologists scored each chest radiograph in consensus for consolidation, ground-glass opacity, location, and pleural fluid. A severity index was determined for each lung. The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score. Results The study was composed of 64 patients (26 men; mean age, 56 years Â± 19 [standard deviation]). Of these, 58 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 81%, 96%), 44 patients had abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%), and 38 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR testing and abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (59%; 95% confidence interval: 46%, 71%). Six patients (9%) showed abnormalities at chest radiography before eventually testing positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 83%, 97%) was higher than that of baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%) (<i>P</i> = .009). Radiographic recovery (mean, 6 days Â± 5) and virologic recovery (mean, 8 days Â± 6) were not significantly different (<i>P</i> = .33). Consolidation was the most common finding (30 of 64; 47%) followed by ground-glass opacities (21 of 64; 33%). Abnormalities at chest radiography had a peripheral distribution (26 of 64; 41%) and lower zone distribution (32 of 64; 50%) with bilateral involvement (32 of 64; 50%). Pleural effusion was uncommon (two of 64; 3%). The severity of findings at chest radiography peaked at 10-12 days from the date of symptom onset. Conclusion Findings at chest radiography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 frequently showed bilateral lower zone consolidation, which peaked at 10-12 days from symptom onset.

As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), degenerative mitral valve disease, and other nonrheumatic valvular diseases were estimated for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Vital registration data, epidemiologic survey data, and administrative hospital data were used to estimate disease burden using the Global Burden of Disease Study modeling framework, which ensures comparability across locations. Geospatial statistical methods were used to estimate disease for all countries, because data on nonrheumatic valvular diseases are extremely limited for some regions of the world, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Results accounted for estimated level of disease severity as well as the estimated availability of valve repair or replacement procedures. DALYs and other measures of health-related burden were generated for both sexes and each 5-year age group, location, and year from 1990 to 2017.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Globally, CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease caused 102â€‰700 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 82â€‰700-107â€‰900) and 35â€‰700 (95% UI, 30â€‰500-42â€‰500) deaths, and 12.6 million (95% UI, 11.4 million-13.8 million) and 18.1 million (95% UI, 17.6 million-18.6 million) prevalent cases existed in 2017, respectively. A total of 2.5 million (95% UI, 2.3 million-2.8 million) DALYs were estimated as caused by nonrheumatic valvular diseases globally, representing 0.10% (95% UI, 0.09%-0.11%) of total lost health from all diseases in 2017. The number of DALYs increased for CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease between 1990 and 2017 by 101% (95% UI, 79%-117%) and 35% (95% UI, 23%-47%), respectively. There is significant geographic variation in the prevalence, mortality rate, and overall burden of these diseases, with highest age-standardized DALY rates of CAVD estimated for high-income countries.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These global and national estimates demonstrate that CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease are important causes of disease burden among older adults. Efforts to clarify modifiable risk factors and improve access to valve interventions are necessary if progress is to be made toward reducing, and eventually eliminating, the burden of these highly treatable diseases.</AbstractText>",NCT04333875,Registry,3/20/2020,12/31/2020,Observational [Patient Registry],Morbidity and Mortality Due to Deferral of Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis,"Active, not recruiting",NA,"University Hospital Inselspital, Berne",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223336,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333875,0,4,4,0,Switzerland,0,2,TAVR or SAVR,NA,0

In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential ""super spreader"" may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD.

A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).</AbstractText>",NCT04661631,Registry,5/8/2020,7/31/2021,Observational [Patient Registry],Surgery and Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19 Infection,Recruiting,NA,Fundacion Clinica Valle del Lili,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240128,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04661631,0,24,24,0,Colombia,0,2,Lung ultrasound,NA,0

Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress, resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation, and difficulties with self-management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to redefining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Because of this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients' needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementational scientific research.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2020 The Obesity Society.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04453579,Registry,3/9/2020,5/4/2020,Observational [Patient Registry],"Bariatric Surgery During Lockdown, Impact of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health",Completed,NA,University of Rome Tor Vergata,NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294297,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453579,0,1,1,0,Italy,0,0,Telephonic interview during the Italian lockdown.,NA,0

The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time. This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) and the high volume of contact staff have with COVID-19 patients has generated an interest in ways to reduce exposure that might be feasible especially during pandemic times and in resource limited healthcare settings. The development of portable barrier hood devices (or intubation/extubation boxes) is an area of interest for many clinicians due to the theoretical reduction in aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus for COVID-19.

We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1Â·84, 95% CI 1Â·53-2Â·21), male sex (1Â·63, 1Â·07-2Â·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1Â·60, 1Â·03-2Â·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4Â·50, 1Â·33-15Â·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3Â·89, 2Â·11-7Â·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5Â·20, 2Â·77-9Â·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2Â·93, 1Â·79-4Â·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded).

Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, evidence indicates a multisystem disease which is frequently severe and often results in death. Long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are unknown, but evidence from previous CoV outbreaks demonstrates impaired pulmonary and physical function, reduced quality of life and emotional distress. Many COVID-19 survivors who require critical care may develop psychological, physical and cognitive impairments. There is a clear need for guidance on the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors. This consensus statement was developed by an expert panel in the fields of rehabilitation, sport and exercise medicine (SEM), rheumatology, psychiatry, general practice, psychology and specialist pain, working at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Stanford Hall, UK. Seven teams appraised evidence for the following domains relating to COVID-19 rehabilitation requirements: pulmonary, cardiac, SEM, psychological, musculoskeletal, neurorehabilitation and general medical. A chair combined recommendations generated within teams. A writing committee prepared the consensus statement in accordance with the appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation criteria, grading all recommendations with levels of evidence. Authors scored their level of agreement with each recommendation on a scale of 0-10. Substantial agreement (range 7.5-10) was reached for 36 recommendations following a chaired agreement meeting that was attended by all authors. This consensus statement provides an overarching framework assimilating evidence and likely requirements of multidisciplinary rehabilitation post COVID-19 illness, for a target population of active individuals, including military personnel and athletes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""STUDY REGISTRATION"">ISRCTN66726260.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Despite its aggressive extension and significant morbidity and mortality, risk factors are poorly characterized outside China. We designed a registry, HOPE COVID-19 (NCT04334291), assessing data of 1021 patients discharged (dead or alive) after COVID-19, from 23 hospitals in 4 countries, between 8 February and 1 April. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality aiming to produce a mortality risk score calculator. The median age was 68Â years (IQR 52-79), and 59.5% were male. Most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (46.8%) and dyslipidemia (35.8%). A relevant heart or lung disease were depicted in 20%. And renal, neurological, or oncological disease, respectively, were detected in nearly 10%. Most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea at admission. 311 patients died and 710 were discharged alive. In the death-multivariate analysis, raised as most relevant: age, hypertension, obesity, renal insufficiency, any immunosuppressive disease, 02 saturationâ€‰&lt;â€‰92% and an elevated C reactive protein (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.87; Hosmer-Lemeshow test, pâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.999; bootstrap-optimist: 0.0018). We provide a simple clinical score to estimate probability of death, dividing patients in four grades (I-IV) of increasing probability. Hydroxychloroquine (79.2%) and antivirals (67.6%) were the specific drugs most commonly used. After a propensity score adjustment, the results suggested a slight improvement in mortality rates (adjusted-OR<sub>hydroxychloroquine</sub> 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.91, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005; adjusted-OR<sub>antiviral</sub> 0.94; 95% CI 0.87-1.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.115). COVID-19 produces important mortality, mostly in patients with comorbidities with respiratory symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine could be associated with survival benefit, but this data need to be confirmed with further trials.

SARS-COV2 (Severe-acute-respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus-type 2) pneumonia can be fatal. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether admittance dysnatremia is associated with mortality, sepsis, or intensive therapy (IT) in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia. This is a retrospective study of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry, with data collected from January 1<sup>th</sup> through April 31<sup>th</sup>, 2020. We selected all hospitalized adult patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-COV2 pneumonia and a registered admission serum sodium level (SNa). Patients were classified as hyponatremic (SNa &lt;135 mmol/L), eunatremic (SNa 135-145 mmol/L), or hypernatremic (SNa &gt;145 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate independent relationships of admission hyponatremia and hypernatremia, with mortality, sepsis, or IT during hospitalization. Four thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, median age 66 (52-77), 58% males. Death occurred in 988 (21.2%) patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 551 (12%) and IT in 838 (18.4%). Hyponatremia was present in 957/4,664 (20.5%) patients, and hypernatremia in 174/4,664 (3.7%). Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia were associated with mortality and sepsis. Only hyponatremia was associated with IT. In conclusion, hyponatremia and hypernatremia at admission are factors independently associated with mortality and sepsis in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""Clinical Trial Registration"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334291, NCT04334291.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2020 Ruiz-SÃ¡nchez, NÃºÃ±ez-Gil, Cuesta, Rubio, Maroun-Eid, Arroyo-Espliguero, Romero, Becerra-MuÃ±oz, Uribarri, Feltes, Trabattoni, Molina, GarcÃ­a Aguado, Pepe, Cerrato, Alfonso, Castro MejÃ­a, Roubin, BuzÃ³n, Bondia, Marin, LÃ³pez Pais, Abumayyaleh, Dâ€™Ascenzo, Rondano, Huang, Fernandez-Perez, Macaya, de Miguel Novoa, Calle-Pascual, Estrada Perez, Runkle and HOPE COVID-19 investigators.</CopyrightInformation>",NCT04334291,Registry,3/23/2020,5/1/2020,Observational [Patient Registry],"International COVID19 Clinical Evaluation Registry,",Completed,NA,"St Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33329400,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334291,8,18,26,0,Spain,0,4,Observational (registry),NA,0

We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p &lt; 0.0001).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care.

It has been proposed that the neuroinvasive potential of the novel SARS-CoV-2 could be due to olfactory bulb invasion, conversely studies suggest it could be a good prognostic factor. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognosis value of OGD in COVID-19. These symptoms were recorded on admission from a cohort study of 5868 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection included in the multicenter international HOPE Registry (NCT04334291). There was statistical relation in multivariate analysis for OGD in gender, more frequent in female 12.41% vs 8.67% in male, related to age, more frequent under 65Â years, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoke, renal insufficiency, lung, heart, cancer and neurological disease. We did not find statistical differences in pregnant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.505), patient suffering cognitive (pâ€‰=â€‰0.484), liver (pâ€‰=â€‰0.1) or immune disease (pâ€‰=â€‰0.32). There was inverse relation (protective) between OGD and prone positioning (0.005) and death (&lt;â€‰0.0001), but no with ICU (0.165) or mechanical ventilation (0.292). On univariable logistic regression, OGD was found to be inversely related to death in COVID-19 patients. The odds ratio was 0.26 (0.15-0.44) (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) and Z was -â€‰5.05. The presence of anosmia is fundamental in the diagnosis of SARS.CoV-2 infection, but also could be important in classifying patients and in therapeutic decisions. Even more knowing that it is an early symptom of the disease. Knowing that other situations as being Afro-American or Latino-American, hypertension, renal insufficiency, or increase of C-reactive protein (CRP) imply a worse prognosis we can make a clinical score to estimate the vital prognosis of the patient. The exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 that causes olfactory and gustative disorders remains unknown but seems related to the prognosis.

In the absence of effective treatment, controlling of risk factors that predispose to severe disease is essential to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. Large observational studies suggest that exercise can reduce the risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the baseline physical activity level on COVID-19 mortality METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study that included patients between 18 and 70Â years old, diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in our center between February 15 and April 15, 2020.

Cox regression identified age (hazard ratio 1Â·02 [95% CI 1Â·01-1Â·03]), Charlson score (1Â·16 [1Â·11-1Â·23]), endotracheal intubation outside of the ICU (ie, before ICU admission; 1Â·37 [1Â·10-1Â·71]), vasopressor use on day 1 (1Â·29 [1Â·07-1Â·55]), D-dimer concentration (1Â·02 [1Â·01-1Â·03]), PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> on day 1 (0Â·998 [0Â·997-0Â·999]), arterial pH on day 1 (1Â·01 [1Â·00-1Â·01]), driving pressure on day 1 (1Â·05 [1Â·03-1Â·08]), acute kidney injury (1Â·66 [1Â·36-2Â·03]), and month of admission (1Â·10 [1Â·03-1Â·18]) as independent predictors of mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">In patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation, lung-protective ventilation was widely used but mortality was high. Predictors of mortality in our study broadly agreed with those identified in studies of invasively ventilated patients in high-income countries. The sustained burden of COVID-19 on scarce health-care personnel might have contributed to high mortality over the course of our study in Argentina. These data might help to identify points for improvement in the management of patients in middle-income countries and elsewhere.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">None.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""TRANSLATION"">For the Spanish translation of the Summary see Supplementary Materials section.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated a large cohort of patients with sepsis with a concomitant COVID-19, and we developed a risk score for the estimation of sepsis risk in COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a sub-analysis from the international Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation Registry for COVID-19 (HOPE-COVID-19-Registry, NCT04334291). Out of 5,837 patients with COVID-19, 624 patients were diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 International Consensus. <b>Results:</b> In multivariable analysis, the following risk factors were identified as independent predictors for developing sepsis: current smoking, tachypnoea (&gt;22 breath per minute), hemoptysis, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &lt;92%, blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP &lt;90 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;60 mmHg), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt;15, elevated procalcitonin (PCT), elevated troponin I (TnI), and elevated creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl. By assigning odds ratio (OR) weighted points to these variables, the following three risk categories were defined to develop sepsis during admission: low-risk group (probability of sepsis 3.1-11.8%); intermediate-risk group (24.8-53.8%); and high-risk-group (58.3-100%). A score of 1 was assigned to current smoking, tachypnoea, decreased SpO<sub>2</sub>, decreased BP, decreased GCS, elevated PCT, TnI, and creatinine, whereas a score of 2 was assigned to hemoptysis. <b>Conclusions:</b> The HOPE Sepsis Score including nine parameters is useful in identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients to develop sepsis.
